## Salesforce Marketing Cloud Landscape



## Salesforce Marketing Cloud Glossary

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC)

The original use of Salesforce Marketing Cloud name, between 2012 and 2014, was for Salesforce's social media management platform created from the merge of two acquired products - Radian6 and Buddy Media.

With the acquisition of [ExactTarget](#exacttarget) in 2013, Salesforce decided that the Marketing Cloud name will be reused for this new flagship Marketing Automation product, which led to renaming the social media platform to [Social Studio](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-social-studio) in 2014. It stayed that way till 2022, when the flagship product was renamed to [Marketing Cloud Engagement](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-engagement-mce).

Salesforce did it to once more reuse the Marketing Cloud name, this time for their new Marketing Automation solution created from the ground up on the [Data Cloud](#salesforce-data-cloud) platform, known also as Marketing Cloud on Core, [Marketing Cloud Growth](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-growth) and [Marketing Cloud Advanced](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-advanced).

Currently the Marketing Cloud name is used frequently for both products (especially in the community), which frequently leads to confusion.

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud Growth (MCG)

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud Advanced (MCA)

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud Next (MCN)

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud Engagement (MCE)

### ExactTarget

Original name of the [Marketing Cloud Engagement](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-engagement-mce) product. Created in 2000 and acquired by Salesforce in 2013. The name is still used in some API endpoints and internal references.

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement (MCAE)

__Name changes__: [Pardot](#pardot) » [Marketing Cloud Account Engagement](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-account-engagement-mcae)

Created in 2007 and moved into Lightning App in 2018

### Pardot

__Name changes__: [Pardot](#pardot) » [Marketing Cloud Account Engagement](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-account-engagement-mcae)

Launched in 2007 as a standalone B2B Marketing Automation platform, bought by [ExactTarget](#exacttarget) in 2012 and acquired along with it by Salesforce in 2013. In 2022 it was renamed to [Marketing Cloud Account Engagement](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-account-engagement-mcae) to align with the rest of the Marketing Cloud products.

The name is still used broadly by the community and can be found in some internal references.

### Salesforce Personalization (SF)

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud Personalization (MCP)

__Name changes__: [Evergage](#evergage) » [Interaction Studio](#interaction-studio) » [Marketing Cloud Personalization](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-personalization-mcp)

Marketing Cloud Personalization is the current name for the product formerly known as [Interaction Studio](#interaction-studio) and [Evergage](#evergage). It is a paid add-on to the [Marketing Cloud Engagement](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-engagement-mce) licence providing real-time personalization capabilities across web, email, mobile and other channels. It uses AI and Machine Learning models to deliver individualized experiences and recomendations based on customer behaviour, preferences, and interactions.

Learn more about Marketing Cloud Personalization in [my MCP Docs](/docs/category/salesforce/marketing-cloud-personalization/).

Since 2023 it is not actively developed further as Salesforce is focusing on recreating its capabilities in the new [Salesforce Personalization](#salesforce-personalization) product built on the [Data Cloud](#salesforce-data-cloud) as a replacement.

### Interaction Studio

__Name changes__: [Evergage](#evergage) » [Interaction Studio](#interaction-studio) » [Marketing Cloud Personalization](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-personalization-mcp)

Name used between 2016 and 2020 for the first standalone real-time personalization product - Thunderhead. After [Evergage](#evergage) acquisition by Salesforce in 2020, Thunderhead Interaction Studio was retired and replaced by Evergage-driven Interaction Studio. In 2022 it was renamed once more to the current [Marketing Cloud Personalization](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-personalization-mcp).

Still in use by some of the community. Might see resurgance due to the MCP acronym being now widely used in the agentic space for Model Context Protocol - including Salesforce.

### Evergage

__Name changes__: [Evergage](#evergage) » [Interaction Studio](#interaction-studio) » [Marketing Cloud Personalization](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-personalization-mcp)

Launched in 2010 as a standalone real-time personalization platform, acquired by Salesforce in 2020 and renamed to [Interaction Studio](#interaction-studio) in 2021. In 2022 it was renamed to [Marketing Cloud Personalization](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-personalization-mcp) to align with the rest of the Marketing Cloud products.

The name is still used in technical areas - endpoints, urls, one of the sitemap namespaces and internal references.

It is a paid add-on to the [Marketing Cloud Engagement](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-engagement-mce) licence providing integration with major ad platforms like Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest and Snapchat. It provides advertising and lead capturing capabilities.

Currently being retired with end of renewals: 15 August 2026.

Salesforce recommends moving to [Data Cloud](#data-cloud) Ad Audiences product as a replacement, but (for now?) there is neither migration path nor feature parity between the two products.

Original name of the [Marketing Cloud Advertising](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-advertising-mca) product launched in 2013. Renamed in 2022 but still used in some internal references.

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud Social Studio

Social Studio was a paid add-on to the [Marketing Cloud Engagement](#salesforce-marketing-cloud-engagement-mce) licence providing social media management capabilities.

It was retired on 18 November 2024.

Salesforce doesn't provide any direct replacement, but recommends using a third-party solution they partnered with: Sprout Social.
