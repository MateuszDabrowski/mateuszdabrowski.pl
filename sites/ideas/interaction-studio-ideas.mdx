## Einstein Recipes

### Multiple Dimensional Variations for Products in Einstein Recipes

Einstein Recipes are a powerful and flexible tool for creating recommendations, but the fourth step - Variations - is not on par with the rest of the options.

You can configure only a single Dimensional Variation. While you can choose from multiple Item Types when configuring it, once you select one, that's the end of the story. You cannot limit recommended products to, for example, only 2 per category and 2 per brand.

It heavily limits control over product recommendations, especially for e-commerce with multiple catalog objects. Currently, there is no real workaround.

At the same time, it is possible to select multiple Boosters or Exclusions of the same type and configure them differently. It would be great to select multiple Dimensional Variations with different configurations.

### Department Variation for Products in Einstein Recipes

Einstein Recipes lets you configure Dimensional Variations on the Category, but unfortunately, it works only on the primary category level. There is no option to select the Department (master category) level.

It is very limiting for e-commerce with broad category trees like:

- monitors (gaming, graphic, office, medical, etc.)
- computers (laptops, ultrabooks, convertibles, desktops, all-in-ones, etc.)
- paints (acrylic, enamel, emulsion, etc.).

With such categories, recommendations with Category Variation configured can easily still be dominated by a similar product (like 12 monitor recommendations despite the Category Variation limit set to 3 due to similar primary categories).

There are two possible solutions to this issue:

1. Add Department as another option in the Item Type dropdown (as it is separate from Categories in Exclusions and Boosters) or
2. When the Item Type Category is selected, add a checkbox on whether Variation should happen on the primary Category or Department level.

Currently, the only workaround is to create a separate Catalog for Departments, but that defeats the purpose of Is Department checkbox on the default Category object.
