## Catalog

### Full Category hierarchy support for ETL

IS can create a working hierarchy tree of categories with a clean subcategory drill-down view in catalog UI and automatic summing of the views and revenue from the lowest level category up in the hierarchy.

However, this is now possible only under multiple conditions: just one Category per product (for the attribution to work), a specific format of the category ID, and only through Sitemap.

Especially problematic is that last limitation because, in many cases, ETL is the better way to manage it - especially with the format required for that feature.

Category ETL already has a solution that provides the same level of detail to Interaction Studio using two out-of-the-box attributes: department and parentCategoryId.

Interaction Studio displays the hierarchy built with those fields on the specific Category page under the ID. Unfortunately, it is not replicating the drill-down hierarchy tree UI in the Category list view and does not pass the data from the bottom Category up the hierarchy.

It should change - there should be a feature parity between Sitemap and ETL for such an important feature. Especially considering that all information required for it is already available.

## Einstein Recipes

### Multiple Dimensional Variations for Products in Einstein Recipes

Einstein Recipes are a powerful and flexible tool for creating recommendations, but the fourth step - Variations - is not on par with the rest of the options.

You can configure only a single Dimensional Variation. While you can choose from multiple Item Types when configuring it, once you select one, that's the end of the story. You cannot limit recommended products to, for example, only 2 per category and 2 per brand.

It heavily limits control over product recommendations, especially for e-commerce with multiple catalog objects. Currently, there is no real workaround.

At the same time, it is possible to select multiple Boosters or Exclusions of the same type and configure them differently. It would be great to select multiple Dimensional Variations with different configurations.

### Department Variation for Products in Einstein Recipes

Einstein Recipes lets you configure Dimensional Variations on the Category, but unfortunately, it works only on the primary category level. There is no option to select the Department (master category) level.

It is very limiting for e-commerce with broad category trees like:

- monitors (gaming, graphic, office, medical, etc.)
- computers (laptops, ultrabooks, convertibles, desktops, all-in-ones, etc.)
- paints (acrylic, enamel, emulsion, etc.).

With such categories, recommendations with Category Variation configured can easily still be dominated by a similar product (like 12 monitor recommendations despite the Category Variation limit set to 3 due to similar primary categories).

There are two possible solutions to this issue:

1. Add Department as another option in the Item Type dropdown (as it is separate from Categories in Exclusions and Boosters) or
2. When the Item Type Category is selected, add a checkbox on whether Variation should happen on the primary Category or Department level.

Currently, the only workaround is to create a separate Catalog for Departments, but that defeats the purpose of Is Department checkbox on the default Category object.

### Price Reduction Ingredient in Einstein Recipes

Triggered Campaigns added a great option of targetting various events for Journey Builder sends. Among them, there are Catalog Triggers. Some of them, like Product Expiring Soon, are also available for Web with Einstein Recipes Ingredients.

However, currently, there is no Ingredient for a popular e-commerce use case - Price Reduction.

Interaction Studio has all the required information (the price and listPrice attributes used for the Triggered Campaign).

There is a workaround to make it possible now - calculating whether product price has been reduced externally and passing this information to a Related Catalog Object. However, there are better solutions for something that Interaction Studio is already doing out-of-the-box for another channel.

There are two possible solutions to this:

1. Simple ingredient that returns all price-reduced items (similar to Trending).
2. Configurable ingredient with an option to select minimum price reduction percent.

The solution can further improve it by adding a Recipe Booster on the price reduction percent.

## ETL

### External Email Campaign ETL Experience Name & ID

[External Email Campaign ETL](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_etl_external_email_campaign_events_data_feed.htm) enables passing behavioural data from Marketing Automation platforms (like Salesforce Marketing Cloud). However, currently, it is limited to a Campaign ID and Campaign Name. It is a problem because to benefit from that data in segmentation fully, it should also allow passing Email ID and Email Name.

The good part - only minimal work is needed, as the groundwork is already laid down. The trick is to leverage it by adding Experience ID and Experience Name columns to the ETL as fields for Email metadata.

When you check the event stream for an outcome from that ETL, you will see it described as `Impression on experience Default in campaign {CAMPAIGN_NAME}`. What is more, the same event will already show (empty) properties `.etl_eeid` (ExternalExperienceID) and `.etl_een` (ExternalExperienceName) that are matching filled in `.etl_ecid` (ExternalCampaignID) and `.etl_ecn` (ExternalCampaignName). Finally, the segmentation is also ready for this extension, as the External Email Campaign ETL is leveraging the same Campaign Stat Count (or Recency) segmentation as Interaction Studio built-in campaigns, leveraging both Campaigns and Experiences.

Currently, one has to choose whether to segment only on emails (without any connection to a specific campaign) or only campaigns (without any ties to specific emails within the campaigns). With that ETL change, we could build segments focusing either on whole Campaigns (f.e. SFMC Journeys) or only particular Emails in selected Journeys (f.e. the First email in Welcome Journey). Easy win for truly targeted Personalization!

### External Email Campaign ETL Send Segmentation

[External Email Campaign ETL](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_etl_external_email_campaign_events_data_feed.htm) enables passing Send, Click and Open data from Marketing Automation platforms (like Salesforce Marketing Cloud). However, only segmentation based on Click and Open (View) is currently supported.

Two options are available in the Campaigns - Campaign Stat Count (or Recency) segmentation rule - `Get sent email campaign` and `Qualify to view (control)` - but neither works for the Send event. It renders that event type useless right now.

Enabling one of the above segmentation rules (preferably `Get sent email campaign`) would unlock use cases like targeting Web or Push campaigns to users who we sent an email campaign, but they never opened it. Great way to fully leverage the cross-channel and real-time nature of Personalization.

### External Email Campaign ETL Unsubscription Event Type

[External Email Campaign ETL](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_etl_external_email_campaign_events_data_feed.htm) enables passing Send, Click and Open data from Marketing Automation platforms (like Salesforce Marketing Cloud). However, currently, it cannot pass unsubscriptions.

Official documentation mentions this event type in the `eventType` column description but doesn't follow it up in the Example Values section. I also performed tests on my side and found it is impossible - Test Run in Feed returns an error: `Transform error: Invalid eventType 'Unsubscribe'. Valid types are Send, Click, Open`. Unsubscription could be easily segmentable as an already existing `Dismissal` action.

Unsubscribe should be added to unlock a wide range of targeted campaigns like surveys about unsubscription reasons, win-back campaigns or replacing email subscription prompts with other channel recommendations.
