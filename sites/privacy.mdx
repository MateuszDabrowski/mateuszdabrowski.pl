## TL;DR

I do not collect your personal data and do not share any information with third parties except for non-personally identifiable, aggregated data used by [Google Analytics Solutions](https://www.google.com/analytics/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## Cookies

Cookies are a small text file that is placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used to make websites work and provide analytical data to the owner of the site. I'm using cookies from two different sources: [Google Analytics Solutions](https://www.google.com/analytics/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

:::note Check yourself
You can check what cookies are in use on any page and what are their values by going to Developer Tools in your browser, navigating to Console tab, writing `document.cookies` and confirming with Enter. Many browsers also have a more detailed view in the Developer Tools. For example, Safari will show you more information about Cookies in the Storage tab.

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics service that tracks and reports website traffic.

Cookie Name | Expiration | Purpose
----------- | ---------- | -------
_ga         | 2 years    | This cookie uses a random number and a timestamp combination to create a unique and anonymous identifier of each visitor
_gid        | 24 hours   | This cookie works just like the one above but is focused on mapping visitor behaviour on the website
_gat        | 1 minute   | This cookie throttles request rate to Google Analytics server

To further protect your privacy, I am not sharing visitor IP with Google Analytics and have Google Advertising Features switched off.

### Cloudflare

Cloudflare is service providing security and protection for websites.

Cookie Name | Expiration | Purpose
----------- | ---------- | -------
_cfduid     | 11 days    | This cookie collects anonymised (one-way hashed) visitor IP addresses to detect malicious ones and minimise blocking legitimate users.
_cf_bm      | 30 minutes | This cookie detects behaviour anomalies to identify and mitigate automated bad bot traffic

## Data processing

I only collect general information such as pages visited, time spent on pages, heat-map of activity on the site, information about the browser, country where you are located, etc. The data collected is used in the aggregated form to improve this website and spot trends without possibility to identify individuals.

Anonymised information mentioned above is aggregated and stored in a central database provided by [Google Analytics Solutions](https://www.google.com/analytics/). It is erased on a regular, rolling basis (after 26 months of inactivity).

Additionally, if you want to stop even this level of processing, most web browsers allow control over most cookies through the browser settings. You may delete the cookies or let them expire. You can also opt-out Google tracking across all websites by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out [browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). If you have any additional questions regarding data processing on this website, feel free to [send me an e&#8209;mail](mailto:legal@mateuszdabrowski.pl).

## Changes

I may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to add information about new tools used on the website that may have access to aggregated data.
