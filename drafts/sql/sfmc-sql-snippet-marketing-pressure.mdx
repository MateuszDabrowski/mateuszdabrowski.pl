1. Check last Open Engagement date and save to DE (with three columns - SubscriberKey, LatestOpenDate, LatestClickDate):

```
SELECT
      s.SubscriberKey   AS SubscriberKey
    , MAX(o.EventDate)  AS LatestOpenDate
FROM _Sent          AS s
    LEFT JOIN _Open AS o
        ON o.SubscriberID = s.SubscriberID
WHERE o.EventDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY s.SubscriberKey
```

2. Check last Click Engagement date and save to the same DE:

```
SELECT
      s.SubscriberKey   AS SubscriberKey
    , MAX(c.EventDate)  AS LatestClickDate
FROM _Sent           AS s
    LEFT JOIN _Click AS c
        ON c.SubscriberID = s.SubscriberID
WHERE c.EventDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY s.SubscriberKey
```

3. Find Count of Sends after those dates:

```
SELECT
      s.SubscriberKey
    , COUNT(*) AS SentCount
FROM _Sent AS s
    INNER JOIN [Engagement Dates] AS e
        ON e.SubscriberKey = s.SubscriberKey
WHERE
    1 = CASE
        WHEN e.LatestOpenDate IS NOT NULL AND e.LatestClickDate IS NOT NULL AND s.EventDate > e.LatestOpenDate AND s.EventDate > e.LatestClickDate THEN 1
        WHEN e.LatestOpenDate IS NOT NULL AND e.LatestClickDate IS NULL AND s.EventDate > e.LatestOpenDate THEN 1
        WHEN e.LatestOpenDate IS NULL AND e.LatestClickDate IS NOT NULL AND s.EventDate > e.LatestClickDate THEN 1
        ELSE 0
    END
GROUP BY s.SubscriberKey
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
```
