## For Loops

### For

The classic for loop is bread and butter in both vanilla JS as well as Marketing Cloud SSJS.

```js title="Example of for loop iterating over an array"
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.log(array[i]);
}
```

For loop will:
1. Execute initial expression (`let i = 0` in the above example).
2. Evaluete the condition (`i < array.length`). If it is false - the loop terminates. If true:
3. The statement within the loop is executed (`console.log(array[i])`).
4. Finally the increment expression will be evalueted (`i++`).
5. Loop goes back to step 2 until it will be false.


The classic for loop might be a bit long to define, but it has a lot of great properties:
- Works with `break` and `continue` statements for better looping control.
- Both initial and incerement expressions can do multiple things.
- Condition is not limited to iterable size.
- Really fast across various scenarios.

If you don't know what will be fastest, pick the classic. To optimize speed even more, cache the length used for condition:

```js title="Initial expression assigns array.length to a variable to cache it"
for (let i = 0, arrayLength = array.length; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    console.log(array[i]);
}
```

### For of

For-of loop was added in ES6 (so forget about using it in Marketing Cloud SSJS...). It loops over iterables: strings, arrays, NodeLists, maps, sets and other array-like objects. Functionality and readibility makes it really interesting option. Let's dive in.

```js title="Example of for-of loop iterating over letters of a string"
for (const letter of name) {
    console.log(letter);
}
```

This loop is blazing fast for very small iterables. From martech perspective, it is fantastic tool to iterate over NodeLists/HTMLCollections when working with DOM. Works great for working with outputs of API calls. Worth using also for operating on split-string-arrays (for example comma-separated strings).

It has also multiple qualities that sets it apart from the classic for loop:

#### Key-Value Pair of Object

It can iterate over key-value paired iterators (for example map or even object - thanks to `Object.entries()`):

```js {1}
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
    console.log(key, value);
}
```

#### Index-Value Pair of Array

It can catch array values along with indexes:

```js {1}
for (const [index, value] of array.entries()) {
    console.log(index, value);
}
```

#### In-place Destructuring

It can destructure object on the go:

```js {3}
const persons = [{ name: 'John Smith' }, { name: 'Jane Doe' }];

for (const { name } of persons) {
    console.log(name); // returns: 'John Smith' \n 'Jane Doe'
}
```

In this example for-of loop not only iterates over objects within an array, but also automatically destructures them by getting the value of the `name` key. Thanks to it, the `console.log` will be printing the names in one line.

#### Iterating over Function Arguments

Thanks to existance of special function variable `arguments`, for-of can loop over undefined amount of arguments.

```js {3} title="Function will return sum of any number of integers provided thanks to for-of loop"
function sum() {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const number of arguments) {
    sum += number;
  }
  return sum;
}

sum(1, 2, 3); // returns: 6
```

### For in

For-in loop is good idea, when you want to loop over object prototype methods and properties. Any other scenario? Not worth it. Don't use it. Just don't<sup>*</sup>.

```js {1}
for (const key in object) {
    console.log(key);
}
```

<sup>*</sup>Supported by Marketing Cloud SSJS - and there it might have some use for working with objects only (as for-of loop is unsupported).

### forEach

For each iterates directly over an array. No need to define a iteration variable. It applies function to each item.

```js {1}
array.forEach((item, index, array) => {
    console.log(`${item} has index ${index}`);
    if (index === array.length - 1) {
        console.log('Last iteration!');
    }
});
```

- `forEach` does not return anything (it should not be assigned to a variable).
- `continue` or `break` won't work.
- In callback function we can leverage up to three optional parameters for an array: item, index, array.
- Due to the fact that it uses callback function, the logic is block scoped.
- Not supported by Marketing Cloud SSJS.

In most scenarios for-of loop will be better choice.

## While Loops

### While

A `while` loop executes its statement as long as condition evaluates to true.

```js {2} title="Infinite while loop"
let run = true
while (run === true) {
    console.log('To the infinity and beyond!');
}
```

To break out of while loop, there must be logic within it that will change the condition to false (or a `break` statement):

```js
let run = true;
let i = 0;
while (run === true) {
    console.log('To the infinity and beyond!');
    i++;
    if (i > 10) {
        run = false;
    }
}
```

`while` loop is best option for iterating over big arrays.

Supported by Marketing Cloud SSJS.

### Do While

Same as while, but the code runs once before evaluating the condition.

```js
do {
    console.log('Running!');
} while (run === true)
```

Supported by Marketing Cloud SSJS.

## Map, Filter, Find, Reduce

### Map

Map takes a data, applies a function to each element of the data and spits out modified data.

```js
const result = array.map(callbackFunction);
```

Map returns an array of the same length but with the modification applied by callbackFunction.

```js title="Example - toProperCase"
['mateusz', 'sara'].map(name => `${name[0].toUpperCase()}${name.slice(1)}`);
```

### Filter

Filter takes data, applies a boolean returning function to each element of the data and spits out filtered down data.
```js
const result = array.filter(callbackFunction);
```

### Find

Find takes data, applies a boolean returning function to each element of the data and spits out first results that matches.

```js
const result = array.find(callbackFunction);
```

### Reduce

Reduce takes data, applies a reducer function to each element of the data and spits out single output value.

```js
const result = array.reduce(callbackFunction);
```

```js title="Example - Sum"
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((accumulator, value) => accumulator + value, 0); // Returns 15; 0 is second optional argument that sets the starting point for accumulating and is useful to safeguard against empty arrays
```

```js title="Example - Avg"
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((accumulator, value) => accumulator + value, 0) / [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].length;
```

```js title="Example - objects array reducer"
const inventory = [
      { type: 'shirt', price: 4000 },
      { type: 'pants', price: 4532 },
      { type: 'socks', price: 234 },
      { type: 'shirt', price: 2343 },
      { type: 'pants', price: 2343 },
      { type: 'socks', price: 542 },
      { type: 'pants', price: 123 },
]

const inventoryCount = inventory.reduce((accumulator, item) => {
    accumulator[item.type] = accumulator[item.type] + 1 || 1
    return accumulator
}, {}); // Starting with empty object instead with 0

const inventoryPrice = inventory.reduce((accumulator, item) => accumulator + item.price, 0);
```
