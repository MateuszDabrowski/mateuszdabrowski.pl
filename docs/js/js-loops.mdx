## For Loops

### For

The classic `for` loop might be a bit long to write, but it has a lot of excellent properties:
- Available in each JavaScript version.
- Works with `break` and `continue` statements for better looping control.
- Both initial and increment expressions can do multiple things.
- Condition is not limited to iterable size.
- Fast across various scenarios.

```js {1} title="Example of for loop iterating over an array"
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.log(array[i]);
}
```

Let's break the script down to five steps each `for` loop follows:
1. Execute initial expression (`let i = 0` in the above example).
2. Evaluate the condition (`i < array.length`). If it is false - the loop terminates. If true:
3. The statement within the loop is executed (`console.log(array[i])`).
4. Finally, the increment expression will evaluate (`i++`).
5. The loop goes back to step 2 until it is false.

If in doubt of which loop to use, pick the classic. To optimize speed, cache the length used for condition:

```js {1} title="Initial expression assigns array.length to a variable to cache it"
for (let i = 0, arrayLength = array.length; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    console.log(array[i]);
}
```

### For of

`For...of` loop came to JavaScript in ES6 (as many good things have). It loops over iterables: strings, arrays, NodeLists, maps, sets and other array-like objects.

```js {1} title="Example of for...of loop iterating over letters of a string"
for (const letter of name) {
    console.log(letter);
}
```

This loop is blazing fast for very small iterables. From martech perspective, it is a fantastic tool to iterate over NodeLists/HTMLCollections when working with DOM. Works great for working with outputs of API calls. Worth also using for operating on split-string-arrays (for example comma-separated strings).

It has many qualities that set it apart from the classic `for` loop:

#### Key-Value Pair of Object

It can iterate over key-value paired iterators (for example map or even object - thanks to `Object.entries()`):

```js {1}
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
    console.log(key, value);
}
```

#### Index-Value Pair of Array

It can catch array values along with indexes:

```js {1}
for (const [index, value] of array.entries()) {
    console.log(index, value);
}
```

#### In-place Destructuring

It can destructure object on the go:

```js {3}
const persons = [{ name: 'John Smith' }, { name: 'Jane Doe' }];

for (const { name } of persons) {
    console.log(name); // returns: 'John Smith' \n 'Jane Doe'
}
```

In this example, `for...of` loop not only iterates over objects within an array but also automatically destructures them by getting the value of the `name` key. Thanks to it, the `console.log` will be printing the names in one line.

#### Iterating over Function Arguments

Thanks to existance of special function variable `arguments`, `for...of` can loop over undefined amount of arguments.

```js {3} title="Function will return sum of any number of integers provided thanks to for-of loop"
function sum() {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const number of arguments) {
    sum += number;
  }
  return sum;
}

sum(1, 2, 3); // returns: 6
```

### For in

`for...in` loop is a good idea when you want to loop over object prototype methods and properties. Any other scenario? Not worth it. Don't use it. Just don't.

```js {1}
for (const key in object) {
    console.log(key);
}
```

### forEach

`forEach` iterates directly over an array. It applies function to each item but does not return anything.

```js {1}
array.forEach((item, index, array) => {
    console.log(`${item} has index ${index}`);
    if (index === array.length - 1) {
        console.log('Last iteration!');
    }
});
```

It differs from other loops:
- No need to define an iteration variable.
- `continue` or `break` won't work.
- In the callback function, we can leverage up to three optional parameters for an array: item, index, array.
- Because it uses a callback function, the logic is block scoped.

In most scenarios, the `for...of` loop will be a better choice.

## While Loops

### While

A `while` loop executes its statement as long as the condition evaluates to true.

```js {2} title="Infinite while loop"
let run = true
while (run === true) {
    console.log('To the infinity and beyond!');
}
```

To break out of `while` loop, there must be logic within it that will change the condition to false (or a `break` statement):

```js {3}
let run = true;
let i = 0;
while (run === true) {
    console.log('To the infinity and beyond!');
    i++;
    if (i > 10) {
        run = false;
    }
}
```

or just:

```js {3} title="This loop has the same outcome as the one above"
let run = true;
let i = 0;
while (i <= 10) {
    console.log('To the infinity and beyond!');
    i++;
}
```

`while` loop is the best option for iterating over **big** arrays.

### Do While

Same as `while`, but the code runs once before evaluating the condition.

```js {1,3}
do {
    console.log('Running!');
} while (run === true)
```

Perfect when you need to run an API call, check whether there are more pages of outcomes and act accordingly.

:::note You Should Know

JavaScript support labels for loops. It allows you to name each loop for even better control with both `continue` and `break` statements.

```js {1,8} title="Labelled loop example using a nested for loops"
MainLoopLabel:
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    // Logic
    SecondaryLoopLabel:
    for (let j = 0; j < array[i].length; j++) {
        // Logic
        if (array[i][j] === 'important') {
            break MainLoopLabel;
        };
    };
};
```

As you can see, in the first line we added a label for the first `for` loop. Then, in the statement within the second `for` loop, we used `break` followed by the label. Once executed, it will break both for loops, even if there were still iterations in the main one. The same approach works with the `continue` statement.
