## What is Document Object Model?

The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of a web document and serves as its programming interface. In simpler words, it let's JavaScript talk with the HTML of the page. And that is huge, especially in Marketing Automation world.

Why? Because it let's you manipulate your website in many ways - visible and not. Dynamic forms adapting to selections, real-time restructring of the pages and data capture. All that is possible thanks to DOM. So let's dive into details.

## Accessing the DOM

To start working with Document Object Model in JavaScript, you just need to use one of the special objects - `window` (browser tab) or `document` (page within that tab). Each of those objects offer multitude of methods that let you interact with a webpage.

### Selecting HTML elements

JavaScript lets you capture specific parts of your website and make them accessible for all your scripting needs with the help of `document` object methods:

- __getElementById__: returns an element with matching id (for example, `document.getElementById('emailAddressField')`)
- __getElementsByTagName__: returns a collection of matching tags (for example, all `document.getElementByTagName('p')` tags)
- __getElementsByName__: returns a collection of tags with matching name (for example, all inputs with name `document.getElementByName('email')`)
- __getElementsByClassName__: returns a collection of tags with matching class (for example, all tags with class `document.getElementByClassName('hiddenContent')`)
- __querySelector__: returns an element with a matching CSS3 selector (for example `document.querySelector('#mainContent .hiddenContent h2')`)
- __querySelectorAll__: returns a collection of elements matching CSS3 selector (for example `document.querySelectorAll('#attributes-repeater .DataCell tr')`)

As you can see, there are a lot of options you can leverage. Which one is right for the job?

The rule of thumb is that if one of the `getElement` selectors can do the job, it's better choice due to optimised performance (the longer HTML, the bigger difference). However, for more complex selections it might either be better or even the only possible choice to use the newer `querySelector` family.

```js title="Good use cases for the querySelector family"
// Instead of using three getElement selectors (that wouldn't even work in this example)
document.getElementById('attributes-repeater').getElementsByClassName('DataCell').getElementsByTagName('tr');
// you should use a single querySelectorAll selector
document.querySelectorAll('#attributes-repeater .DataCell tr');

// There are also cases where querySelector is the only choice
document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]');
```

As always, the devil lies in the details. While chained `getElement` selectors will have better performance than clean `querySelector`, there are three issues with the former:

1. Readability: after two or three selectors the `getElement` chain gets really hard to read and debug, natural CSS3 style of `querySelector` is much more straightforward.
2. Flexibility: you can only chain `getElements` on single elements. Refering to the previous code sample, while the `.getElementsByClassName('DataCell')` called on single outcome of `.getElementById('attributes-repeater')` works, returned collection of outcomes would crash the `.getElementsByTagName('tr')`.
3. Loopability: outcomes of `getElements` selection cannot be looped using [`forEach()`](./js-loops.mdx#foreach).

So my approach is to use the more flexible and readable `querySelector` whenever performance is not a dealbraker, and switch where possible to `getElement` toolset when the performance is crucial.
