## What is Document Object Model?

The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of a web document and serves as its programming interface. In simpler words, it let's JavaScript talk with the HTML of the page. And that is huge, especially in Marketing Automation world.

Why? Because it let's you manipulate your website in many ways - visible and not. Dynamic forms adapting to user actions, pages changing in real time and enhanced data capture. All that is possible thanks to DOM. So let's dive into details.

## Accessing the DOM

To start working with Document Object Model in JavaScript, you need to use one of the special objects - `window` (browser tab) or `document` (page within that tab). Each of those objects offer multitude of methods that let you interact with a webpage.

JavaScript lets you capture specific parts of your website and make them accessible for all your scripting needs with the help of `document` object methods:

- __getElementById__: returns an element with matching id (for example, `document.getElementById('emailAddressField')`)
- __getElementsByTagName__: returns a collection of matching tags (for example, all `document.getElementByTagName('p')` tags)
- __getElementsByName__: returns a collection of tags with matching name (for example, all inputs with name `document.getElementByName('email')`)
- __getElementsByClassName__: returns a collection of tags with matching class (for example, all tags with class `document.getElementByClassName('hiddenContent')`)
- __querySelector__: returns an element with a matching CSS3 selector (for example `document.querySelector('#mainContent .hiddenContent h2')` - notice the `#` prefix for id and `.` for a class). If there are multiple matching elements - it will return the first one.
- __querySelectorAll__: returns a collection of elements matching CSS3 selector (for example `document.querySelectorAll('#attributes-repeater .DataCell tr')`)

:::note You Should Know

`querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` allows you to select elements using the power of CSS3. It means that you can go really specific with he right syntax.

You can select:
1. Tag by its name: `document.querySelector('body')`
2. Id with `#` prefix: `document.querySelector('#idName')`
3. Class with `.` prefix: `document.querySelector('.className')`
4. Tag with specific class by chaining: `document.querySelector('div.className')`
5. Element with two classes: `document.querySelector('.className1.className2')` (notice lack of space between classes)
6. Element that is direct child of another element: `document.querySelector('div > h2')`
7. Element that is any child another element: `document.querySelector('div h2')`
8. Element that is any sibling (has the same parent): `document.querySelector('p.className ~ h2')` (this will capture `h2` that is under the same parent as `p.className`)
9. Element that is adjecent sibling (has the same parent): `document.querySelector('p.className + h2')` (this will capture `h2` that is under the same parent as `p.className` and after that paragraph)
10. Element with specific attribute: `document.querySelector('[href]')`
11. Element with specific value of attribute: `document.querySelector('input[type="checkbox"]')`
12. One of the listed elements: `document.querySelector('ul, ol')`
13. All of the listed elements: `document.querySelectorAll('ul, ol')`
14. Elements targetet by [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes): `document.querySelectorAll('a:visited')`
15. [Pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements): `document.querySelectorAll('h1::first-letter')`
16. Element with negated selection: `document.querySelector('.className:not(div)')`

Sky is the limit, especially with chaining all of the above into single super query:

```js
document.querySelector('#content > article > div:nth-child(20) a:nth-child(1) > code');
```

However, whenever possible, optimise. Either by finding a better way to select the element or (if possible) by adding easily selectable attribute to that element in the page HTML.

:::

As you can see, there are a lot of options you can leverage.

### Should you use getElement or querySelector?

The rule of thumb is that if one of the `getElement` selectors can do the job, it's better choice due to optimised performance (the longer HTML, the bigger difference). However, for more complex selections it might either be better or even the only possible choice to use the newer `querySelector` family.

```js title="Good use cases for the querySelector family"
// Instead of using three getElement selectors (that wouldn't even work in this example)
document.getElementById('attributes-repeater').getElementsByClassName('DataCell').getElementsByTagName('tr');
// you should use a single querySelectorAll selector
document.querySelectorAll('#attributes-repeater .DataCell tr');

// There are also cases where querySelector is the only choice
document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]');
```

As always, the devil lies in the details. While chained `getElement` selectors will have better performance than clean `querySelector`, there are three issues with the former:

1. Readability: after two or three selectors the `getElement` chain gets really hard to read and debug, natural CSS3 style of `querySelector` is much more straightforward.
2. Flexibility: you can only chain `getElements` on single elements. Refering to the previous code sample, while the `.getElementsByClassName('DataCell')` called on single outcome of `.getElementById('attributes-repeater')` works, returned collection of outcomes would crash the `.getElementsByTagName('tr')`.
3. Loopability: outcomes of `getElements` selection cannot be looped using [`forEach()`](./js-loops.mdx#foreach).

So my approach is to use the more flexible and readable `querySelector` whenever performance is not a dealbraker, and switch where possible to `getElement` toolset when the performance is crucial.

:::note You Should Know

You can assign your DOM selection to a variable. It not only allow you to reuse it in multiple places of your script, but also let's you limit the scope of the selection.

You can do the latter by replacing the `document` object with your variable - it will look for matching DOM elements only within the outcome of the previous seletion.

```js
const form = document.querySelector('form');
const divsInForm = form.querySelectorAll('div.legalNotice'); // Returns only div tags with legalNotice class that are within your form
```

It works like chaining selectors and with the same limitation - you can chain only if previous outcome is single element.

```js
/* ✅ Chain from a single element to a collection - same outcome as previous code snippet */
document.querySelector('form').querySelectorAll('div.legalNotice');

/* ❌ Chain from a collection to a collection - will throw TypeError */
document.querySelectorAll('form').querySelectorAll('div.legalNotice');

/* ✅ Chain from a single element (thanks to index) to a collection */
document.querySelectorAll('form')[0].querySelectorAll('div.legalNotice');

/* Of course, in real scenario, you should use a compound selector for the same result */
document.querySelectorAll('form div.legalNotice');
```

:::

Selecting elements is just the beginning. Once you pick them, you can [explore](#exploring-the-dom), [traverse](#traversing-the-dom) and [manipulate](#manipulating-the-dom) the DOM. You can check what is available for selected element with `console.dir(selectedElement)` in the developer console.

## Exploring the DOM

Once you select the page element, you can learn more about it thanks to properties. There is a [long list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element]) of available features, so let's focus on the ones most useful in marketing automation and real-time personalisation world.

### attributes

With `.attributes` property you can list all HTML attributes on selected element as a NamedNodeMap. What is more, you can drill down on those details to get specific values:

```js
/* <main id="content" class="main-content" role="main">…</main> */
document.querySelector('#content').attributes;              // returns a Map with id, class and role
document.querySelector('#content').attributes.class.value;  // returns 'main-content'
```

While it is great way of learning what attributes are used on a specific elements, in most scenarios the attribute-specific shorthand properties will be much more useful.

You can also list the names of all available attributes using `.getAttributesNames()`. There is also `getAttrubute()` method that lets you pull a value of specific attribute and a pair of condition checking methods: `hasAttributes()` that checks whether selected element has any attribute and `hasAttribute()` that tells you if the selected element has a specified attribute.

```js
/* <main id="content" class="main-content" role="main">…</main> */
document.querySelector('#content').getAttributesNames();    // returns ['id', 'class', 'role']
document.querySelector('#content').getAttrubute('role');    // returns 'main'
document.querySelector('#content').hasAttrubutes();         // returns true
document.querySelector('#content').hasAttrubute('role');    // returns true
```

This method is useful for non-standard attributes that doesn't have a dedicated shorthand.

### classList and className

The `.classList` property let's you directly list all classes assigned to the selected element (in a form of DOMTokenList). It is great when you want to [loop](./js-loops.mdx) through to find a specific class or [manipulate the DOM](#manipulating-the-dom).

On the other hand, when you want to do a simple [check or condition](./js-if-and-switch.mdx), `.className` is a great shorthand returning a string with all classes.

```js
/* <div class="page-wrapper category-api document-page">…</div> */
document.querySelector('div.page-wrapper').classList;                           // returns an object with all the classes, length and value
document.querySelector('div.page-wrapper').classList.contains('document-page'); // returns true
document.querySelector('div.page-wrapper').classList.value;                     // returns 'page-wrapper category-api document-page'
document.querySelector('div.page-wrapper').className;                           // shorthand of the previous, returns 'page-wrapper category-api document-page'
```

The `.classList` property is the bread and butter of page manipulation, as it allows you to add, remove, replace and toggle classes on an element. Think of hiding and displaying elements, changing the styles and other dynamic scenarios. More on that, in the [Manipulating the DOM](#manipulating-the-dom) section.

### id and tagName

Similarly to class-related properties, there is `.id` property that returns the value of id attribute and `.tagName` property that returns name of the selected tag.

```js
/* <main id="content" class="main-content" role="main">…</main> */
document.querySelector('.main-content').id;      // returns 'content'
document.querySelector('.main-content').tagName; // returns 'main'
```

Those two are less frequently used and mostly have some value when [travelling through the DOM](#traversing-the-dom).

### innerText and innerHTML

Another extremly important properties are `.innerText` and `.innerHTML`. They allow you to look into what is within the selected element.

`.innerText` returns a plain text version of element content (including all child tags within). Think the result of copy pasting fragment of the page into a chat.

```js title="Example output for header of this section"
document.querySelector('#innertext-and-innerhtml').innerText;
// returns ".innerText and .innerHTML"
```

`.innerHTML`, on the other hand, will return a full blown HTML code of the selected element (including all child tags within). Keep in mind, however, that it will be the rendered HTML, not the original HTML (so the version adapted to your screen, your device, your context).

```js title="Example output for header of this section"
document.querySelector('#innertext-and-innerhtml').innerHTML;
// returns ".innerText and .innerHTML<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#innertext-and-innerhtml\" title=\"Direct link to heading\"></a>"
```

While it is already useful, those properties shine when you want to [manipulate your page](#manipulating-the-dom). More on that later.

### hidden and style

Finally, there are landing page must-haves - `.hidden` and `.style`. Those two properties describe the CSS of the selected element.

`.hidden` is straightforward. It returns a boolean telling you whether the element is hidden from the frontend of the page.

`.style` is much deeper, as it returns a whole object build with all possible __inline__ CSS declarations for the element. You can then drill down to return a value of specific declaration.

```js title="Example output for header of this section"
document.querySelector('#hidden-and-style').hidden;         // returns false
document.querySelector('#hidden-and-style').style.display;  // returns ''
```

As with other properties mentioned previously, those true shine when [manipulating the DOM](#manipulating-the-dom).

## Traversing the DOM

Think about the DOM as a complex hierarchy of elements. When you select specific element, it is located somewhere within that hierarchy. And with the help of the properties you can learn more about that web and travel through it.

Before jumping to the specific ways to travel through the page, let's settle the DOM naming convention for the hierarchy of elements:

```html title="HTML snippet"
<article class="main-page-content">
    <h1>Main Header</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            <strong>Example paragraph</strong> with some written content and a <a href="https://mateuszdabrowski.pl">link</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another paragraph of this article.
        </p>
    </div>
</article>
```

Let's select the `div` tag from the above structure using:

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div'); // selects <div>
```

As you can see there are three relationships between the selected `div` tag and the rest of the code:

1. The selected `div` tag is enclosed within `<article class="main-page-content">`. The tag higher in the DOM hierarchy is called __parent__.
2. The selected `div` tag is not alone within the `<article class="main-page-content">` parent tag. There is also `h1`. The tags at the same level of DOM hierarchy are called __siblings__.
3. The selected `div` tag has two `p` tags within itself. The tags lower in the DOM hierarchy are called __children__.

To sum up, our `div` tag has `article` as a parent, `h1` as a sibling, and two `p` as children. What is more, the first `p` has two inline children of its own: `strong` and `a`.

Let's check how to levarege all those informations.

### parentElement

If you want to go up in the hierarchy from your selection you can just use `.parentElement` (or `.parentNode` that is nearly the same now).

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').parentElement; // selects <article class="main-page-content">
```

### previousElementSibling and nextElementSibling

For traversing the sibling elements, you can use either `.previousElementSibling` or `.nextElementSibling` to jump to previous or next Element respectively. If there is no such element, you will get `null`.

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').previousElementSibling; // selects <h1>
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').nextElementSibling; // returns null
```

:::note You Should Know

You can also encounter similar properties - `.previousSibling` and `.nextSibling`. That pair is operating on HTML Nodes and will return for example whitespace between the elements (as `#test` node) or HTML comments. Unless you are sure you need it,  `.previousElementSibling` or `.nextElementSibling` are better choice.

:::

### All things children

When you want to go down in the hierarchy, you can use `.children` to get a Collection of HTML elements.

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').children; // returns collection of two <p> tags
```

You can either [loop](./js-loops.mdx) through those or pick a specific children with an index. Helpful here can be `.childElementCount` that will show you the number of elements selected.

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').childElementCount; // returns 2
```

The nice thing is that for the most popular selections - the first and last child - you can use a clean shorthands `.firstElementChild` and `.lastElementChild`.

```js
/* ❌ Unnecessary complex selection of the first and last child */
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').children[0]; // selects first child
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').children[document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').childElementCount - 1]; // selects last child

/* ✅  Optimised and readable selection of first and last child */
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').firstElementChild; // selects first child
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').lastElementChild;  // selects last child
```

:::note You Should Know

Like with sibling selection, here also you have set of similar properties - `.childNodes`, `.firstChild`, `.lastChild`. All three work on Nodes, so will pick up not only elements, but also text (whitespace) and comments. Unless you are sure you need it, `.children`, `.firstElementChild` and `.lastElementChild` are better choice.

:::

### The power of DOM traversing

Ok, we know how to traverse the DOM, but why should we? The beauty of using the above mentioned properties is that after traversing you can leverage all [exploratory properties](#exploring-the-dom) as you would on a normally selected element.

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').parentElement.className; // returns "main-page-content"
```

You can also mix and match the traversing properties to jump multiple levels of the hierarchy.

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').firstElementChild.lastElementChild.href // returns "https://mateuszdabrowski.pl/"
```

Finally, you are not limited by the need to know the exact path from the currently selected element to another one __higher in hierarchy__ that you are interested in. You can leverage `.closest` method to find it using the same CCS3 selection as with [`querySelector`](#accessing-the-dom).

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').closest('.main-page-content'); // selects <article class="main-page-content">
```

Keep in mind that `.closest` can select the originally selected element if it fulfills the new selection. If you want to stop it from happening, you can just chain it after `.parentElement`.

```js
document.querySelector('article.main-page-content > div').parentElement.closest('.main-page-content'); // selects <article class="main-page-content">
```

## Manipulating the DOM

Everything discussed up to this point was nice, but not breathtaking. Time to change it and jump straight into the real reason it is worth to learn about the DOM. The ins and outs of manipulating it with JavaScript methods.

### addEventListener

One of the key manipulation methods for marketing automation is adding events with `.addEventListener`. This method lets you perform some actions (a function) given a specific behaviour.

In simpler words, you can tell the browser to execute a JavaScript function when the user clicks a button. Or moves the mouse out of the page to close it or change a tab. Or perform any other event you configure. You do it by attaching a specified Event Listener to a document, window or selected element:

```js title="Example of attaching Click-based Event Listener on a <button> that logs click details to console"
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', event => console.log(event));
```

:::note You Should Know

Using anonymous functions like in the example above is __not recommended__. Each anonymous function is unique for the JavaScript, even if they have exactly the same code within. This leads to two issues:

1. You may add multiple instances of the same anonymous function to a single element (no deduplication). It will lead not only to negative performance impact, but also the function being triggered multiple times on event.
2. You cannot remove such anonymous Event Listener.

In real world scenarios use named functions (unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing and have booked some time for debugging in the future):

```js
function consoleLogEvent(event) {
    console.log(event)
}

document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', consoleLogEvent);
```

It will allow you to easily remove Event Listener (by referencing the target, event type and named function) once it is no longer needed:

```js
document.querySelector('button').removeEventListener('click', consoleLogEvent);
```

:::

#### Event types

There is over a hundred of available events that you can use, so I will focus only on the most useful ones for our Marketing Automation needs.

##### Click

Capturing a click event is probably the most popular event in the world wide web. Technically, it's a shorthand for two separate events (that you can listen for seprately as well) - `mousedown` and `mouseup`.

The interesting part is that the event captures the number of consecutive clicks happening in short timeframe, so you can distinguish single, double, tripleclicks:

```js
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click',
    event => console.log(`Click count: ${event.detail}`)
);
```

##### Submit

Another marketing must-have is the submit event. It is triggered on valid submission of a form.

```js
document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit',
    event => console.log(`Submission timestamp: ${event.timeStamp}`) // miliseconds since the page/script load
);
```

The key feature with submit events is possibility to stop the default form processing with `.preventDefault` method:

```js {5}
document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit',
    event => {
        const formData = Object.fromEntries(new FormData(event.target));
        console.log(formData);
        event.preventDefault();
    }
);
```

This approach allows you to implement any custom validation or data processing while still benefitting from the HTML5 form backbone. Perfect when you want to push your form submission to a [Code Resource](../usecase/sfmc-code-resource.mdx#good-form-backend-with-code-resource).

##### Focus & Blur

Another events that are very useful for forms are focus and blur. The first one is triggered when when element gets into focus, the other is the opposite. What does it mean? Let's say you have a form. When user click on the input, the input element gets focused. When he clicks on something else (another element, submit button, or just anywere else) it triggers blur event.

```js
document.querySelector('input[type="email"]').addEventListener('blur',
    event => console.log(event.target.value)
);
```

Using blur event can be great for triggering asynchronous checks on the provided data. For example, after user finishes writing the email and goes to the next field, the Event Listener can trigger an asynchronous call to [Code Resource backend](../usecase/sfmc-code-resource.mdx#good-form-backend-with-code-resource) to lookup whether this record is existing contact or needs to be created in Salesforce Sales Cloud first to generate the Contact ID.




Those are just few key events that you can capture with `.addEventListener`. There is much more available, like scroll, paste, . Check the full list on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#event_listing).

### Changing attributes
