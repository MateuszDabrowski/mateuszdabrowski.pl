<LeadText content='Highly opinionated choice of JavaScript coding conventions I found useful. Treat as inspiration.' />

## Variables

### var, let, const

I use `var` only in SSJS (as it is the only available there...). In modern JS environment, I opt for `let` or `const`.

### Undefined variables

If I declare variables without value (for example in SSJS before try/catch block), I use shorthand to make the code shorter and make it clear that those will be defined later.

```js
let variableOne, variableTwo, variableThree;
```

### Defined variables

If the variables are defined already with (initial) value, I always write them on separate lines for easier reading.

```js
let variableOne = 1;
let variableTwo = 2;
```

If both scenarios happen in the same code, I use both above conventions. This help me clearly see which variables are yet to have value assigned (or should be deleted due to lack of use).

```js
let variableOne, variableTwo, variableThree;
let variableFour = 4;
const variableFive = 5;
```

## Conditions

### Condition shorthand

Whenever possible, I use condition shorthand in falsy and truthy cases.

```js
if (isLoginValid && isPasswordValid) { // instead of: isLoginValid === true
    // Log in
} else if (isLoginValid && !isPasswordValid) {
    // Propose password reminder process
} else {
    // Propose to try aagain
}
```

### Ternary operator

For simple `if` statements with just two options I use ternary operator to make it shorter.

```js
const gender = firstName.endsWith('a') ? 'female' : 'male' // It works for polish names ;)
```

## Functions

### Default parameters

Whenever possible, I use default parameters in functions to make calls simpler for base scenarios.

```js
const request = (method = 'GET', baseUrl = 'https://www.example.com/rest/', endpoint, payload = '') => {
    // API handler
}

let response = request(endpoint = 'users')
```
