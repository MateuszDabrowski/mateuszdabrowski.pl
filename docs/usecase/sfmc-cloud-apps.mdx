## Cloud Apps: what and why

### When out-of-the-box features are not enough

Salesforce Marketing Cloud offers a multitude of options. With all the Studios, Builders, and other Salesforce-ecosystem cross-sells, you can deliver nearly anything. Nearly.

There will always be some business processes or requirements that are too niche or too unique to be covered out-of-the-box. Sometimes they can be delivered with what is available after some compromises. Sometimes only custom development can help.

Depending on the use case and company resources, you can overcome such challenges in two ways. By shopping at AppExchange - Salesforce App Store with 3rd Party solutions - or by building a custom application connected to Marketing Cloud with APIs (for example, leveraging yet another Salesforce product - Heroku).

AppExchange might be a great idea if you can find a product solving your problem, but it will add a recurring cost to your budget. On the other hand, a fully-fledged custom application might deliver precisely what you need but will create considerable up-front cost (in either money for external developers or time for an in-house team) and require maintenance.

There is, however, the third path. One that can be perfect if you have a necessary but relatively small requirement for internally used power-up and would instead go lean on both budget and time — Marketing Cloud micro application.

### Out-of-the-box approach to out-of-the-box feature

Marketing Cloud micro application offers AppExchange-style deep integration with Marketing Cloud platform and solution flexibility of custom development. In short, it is an application hosted on a Cloud Page and available via the main menu of Marketing Cloud. A Cloud App.

The good? You can use Marketing Cloud programmatic languages (SSJS and AMPScript) with all their nifty built-in functions to control the assets and behaviours of the SFMC platform and connected Sales & Service Clouds. You can also leverage the APIs to gather even more power and pull external logic and data. All this without having to care about hosting, scaling and integration. Available directly from the Marketing Cloud menu. And cost? Just a super message for loading a Cloud Page.

The bad? It is suitable for relatively simple apps. Think about a single front-end page powered by an SSJS or AMPScript backend on a Code Resource. Of course, you can try to build something more complex, but you may quickly get into a place where the whole endeavour would have been easier with an outside-hosted application.

## Build your dream

So what can you do with such a solution? Possibilities are endless, but to share a few use cases:

- Marketing Cloud Asset Viewer that allows you to quickly locate, for example, a Data Extension or Content asset.
- Data Extension Analyzer for quick data analysis or even visualisation of values from a selected Data Extension.
- KPI Dashboard displaying the most critical data for understanding your communication's current state - or even related data from Sales or Service Cloud imported using functions enabled by Marketing Cloud Connect.
- Deliverability Dashboard pulling data from Marketing Cloud and external deliverability monitoring and alerting tools.
- Documentation or FAQ related to your company processes and best practices that everyone should follow when building customer experience through Marketing Cloud.
- Templated Journey creator to deploy tested flows for most used campaigns in a single click.

Anything related to Marketing Cloud that you wish could be a bit more automated or easy can be a good idea for a micro application approach.

## Cloud Apps step by step

### Create your first Marketing Cloud micro-application

Implementation is very straightforward, and you can do it in few minutes:

1. Create a simple Cloud Page (blank page with a "Hello World" will do the job for now).
2. Publish it and copy the URL of the Cloud Page.
3. Go to Marketing Cloud Setup -> Apps -> Installed Packages and create a New Package.
4. Add a Marketing Cloud App Component to the Package, paste the Cloud Page URL in both Endpoint fields and Save.

That's all. You just created your first Marketing Cloud micro application. Refresh Marketing Cloud to see it available in the main menu under the AppExchange icon. Now it's time to build up your solution to solve the business need.

### A Good application is a secure application

Your micro application is now available from the Marketing Cloud menu. But unfortunately, it can also be accessed from any other place, as it is still just a simple Cloud Page. It is, of course, not ideal. You don't want your API-fueled solution to be accessed by random people.

#### API Integration Component

Thankfully, you can leverage the already created Installed Package to cleanly secure the micro application. To do so, add yet another Component to the Package - this time, you will need API Integration one. Select Web App integration type and paste your micro application Cloud Page URL to the Redirect URI field.

You don't need to select anything in the Scope to secure your micro application. But if you plan on using the API calls, feel free to choose the required areas now. If you only want to leverage built-in SSJS and AMPScript functions, keep them unchecked.

Once you save the Component, you will see that your Installed Package API Component now lists: `Client Id`, `Client Secret`, and `API Base URI`. Copy those, as you will need them in the next step.

:::note You Should Know

After you create your Installed Package, there will be three base URI's available - Authentication, REST and SOAP. All of them, after the `https://`, have a common alphanumeric string with hyphens that is unique to your SFMC. I copy only this part, as it can be used to build any endpoint necessary for the application.

For example for `https://abcdefghi-jklmnoprst-123456.auth.marketingcloudapis.com/` the `API Base URI` is `abcdefghi-jklmnoprst-123456`.

:::

#### API Authorisation

With the above pre-work completed, you can use SSJS or AMPScript on your Cloud Page to redirect to the `v2/authorise` endpoint of your Authentication Base URI before loading. It will require any visitor to log into your Marketing Cloud to load your micro application. What's even better, it will automatically load it for users already logged in (micro Single Sign-On).

You will need to pass `Client Id` and `Cloud Page URL` (for redirect after successful login) as query parameters to your authorisation redirect. Another necessary thing is Response Type equal to code. Finally, you can pass a State. The value of this parameter will be available after the redirect. It is excellent for recognising whether someone opened your micro application in a pre- (no state) or post- (available state) login context.

    '?response_type=code&client_id=',@ClientID,
    '&redirect_uri=',@AppURL,'&state=',@Session)
Redirect(@RequestURL)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### API Authentication with Token

Once your micro application refreshes after authorisation, you can get the code query string parameter with SSJS or AMPScript function and use it to make a POST API call to Authentication Basą URI - this time to `v2/token` endpoint. As the code from the authorisation endpoint is required in the payload, receiving the token in the response will validate that the visitor is eligible to access the micro application and use it.

<Tabs

var payload = {
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    code: code,
    client_id: clientID,
    client_secret: clientSecret,
    redirect_uri: appURL
}

var response = HTTP.Post('https://' + clientBase + '.auth.marketingcloudapis.com/v2/token', 'application/json', Stringify(payload))

if (response.StatusCode == 200) {
    var parsedResponse = Platform.Function.ParseJSON(response.Response[0])
    var accessToken = parsedResponse.access_token;
    var tokenExpire = Platform.Function.SystemDateToLocalDate(Platform.Function.Now())
    tokenExpire.setMinutes(tokenExpire.getMinutes() + 18);
}

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='ampscript'>

```js {19} title="API Token Authorization Flow"
VAR @ClientID, @ClientSecret, @ClientBase, @AppURL, @Code, @RequestURL, @Token, @APIStatus, @Response

SET @ClientID = 'CLIENT_ID';
SET @ClientSecret = 'CLIENT_SECRET';
SET @ClientBase = 'API_BASE_URI';
SET @AppURL = 'APP_CLOUD_PAGE_URL'
SET @Code = RequestParameter('code')

SET @RequestURL = Concat('https://',@ClientBase,'.auth.marketingcloudapis.com/v2/token')

SET @Payload = Concat(
    '{"grant_type": "authorization_code",',
    '"code": "',@Code,'",',
    '"client_id": "',@ClientID,'",',
    '"client_secret": "',@ClientSecret,'",',
    '"redirect_uri": "',@AppURL,'"}'
)

HTTPPost2(@RequestURL,'application/json',@Payload,false,@APIStatus,@Response)
SET @Token = Substring(@APIStatus,18,512)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This way, you just added a micro Single Sign-On feature that is as secure as your Marketing Cloud. And that's not all! As now only your Marketing Cloud users can access the application, you can leverage the Installed Package Access tab to control who will see your solution in the main menu.

Now you have a secure, SSO-enabled micro application deeply integrated with Marketing Cloud ready to solve your business needs and power-up your Marketing Team.

:::note You Should Know

Adding this micro-SSO process blocks Web Studio from loading the Cloud Page in Preview. During development you either have to comment out the SSO or validate the changes only by publishing and checking in the Cloud App directly.

:::

#### Capture your Cloud App usage

We can leverage the above method even further by adding a logging solution that will store session and log history. To do so, we will need a Data Extension and a bit more code around the above snippets.

You will need only one Logging Data Extension for any number of micro-applications. Create one with the following structure (`session` column being the Primary Key):

| Name | DataType | Default Value | Length | Nullable |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 🔑 session | Text | | 50 | No |
| appName | Text | | 50 | Yes |
| createdDate | Date | Current date | | Yes |
| token | Text | | 520 | Yes |
| tokenExpire | Date | | | Yes |

As for data retention, 1 day for Individual Records is enough for authorization purposes. However, you can extend it for logging history purposes. Keep in mind that the more data there will be stored, the slower the Data Extension LookupRows speeds will be.

On the code side, two elements will be necessary - one for adding the data after successfull authentication and one for checking whether the current session is valid.

<Tabs
    groupId='cloudAppCode'
    defaultValue='ssjs'
    values={[
        {label: 'SSJS', value: 'ssjs'},
        {label: 'AMPScript', value: 'ampscript'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='ssjs'>

```js title="Fill Cloud App Logging Data Extension"
Platform.Function.UpsertData(authDE, ['session'], [state], ['appName', 'token', 'tokenExpire'], [appName, accessToken, tokenExpire]);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='ampscript'>

```js itle="Fill Cloud App Logging Data Extension"
UpsertData(@AuthDE,1,'session',@State,'appName',@AppName,'token',@Token,'tokenExpire',DateAdd(Now(),18,'MI'))
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This approach will enable you to safely split your application into front end (Cloud Page) and back end (Code Resource) to improve user experience and optimise speed and cost.

## Secured Cloud App Template

By taking into consideration all above elements, we get powerful and secure template for our Cloud Apps.

To implement it, copy and paste below code to the top of the Cloud Page used for the App. Next, change the values in the top of the code (the uppercase ones) to match your package installation and app details (all values should be passed as strings within `'value'`). That's all!

    defaultValue='ssjs'
    values={[
        {label: 'SSJS', value: 'ssjs'},
        {label: 'AMPScript', value: 'ampscript'},
    ]}

:::note You Should Know

Any reload done within the app (Reload/Redirect/Post via Form) should point back to Apps Cloud Page URL with `'state=' + state` appended to it as a query parameter (remember to use `?` if it will be first parameter or `&` in other case).

You can also leverage the session to lookup the token for API calls: `Platform.Function.Lookup(authDE, 'token', 'session', state)`
