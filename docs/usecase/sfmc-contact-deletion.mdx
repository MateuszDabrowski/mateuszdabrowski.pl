## Contact Deletion in SFMC

Salesforce Marketing Cloud makes Contact Deletion not only easy but also powerful. The out-of-the-box solution does the most of the heavy lifting leaving to us the decision who and when should be deleted from our platform.

So what exactly is the built-in SFMC Contact Deletion process doing behind the scenes?

1. It manages __supression period for contacts__ requested for deletion:
    - Suppression in __Contact Builder__ hides the contacts and blocks possibility to create a new one with the same Contact Key.
    - Suppression in __Email Studio__ hides the contacts and blocks them from receiving Emails or interacting with Triggered Sends.
    - Suppression in __Journey Builder__ blocks the contacts from entering Journeys and Automations.
    - Suppression in __Mobile Studio__ (MobileConnect, MobilePush, GroupConnect) hides the contacts and blocks them from receiving any communication and doing any interactions (exception - block requests are still processed).
    - Suppression in __Einstein__ hides the contacts and blocks both Recommendations as well as Analytics.
2. After the suppresion period, it __deletes contacts__ from:
    - Sendable Data Extensions
    - Populations
    - Lists
    - Groups
    - Journeys
    - Automations
    - Einstein

As you can see, a lot out-of-the-box. But what is the purpose of the supression period when we just want to delete some contacts?

Contact Deletion is irreversible. Once contact is deleted, it is deleted for good and there is no option to bring it back. Sure, you can add the contact again, but it won't have any of the old data. So, if you are not confident in your Contact Deletion process, you might [configure suppression period](#enable-contact-deletion) to have some time for reflection. That's why it is there by default (currently at 2 days). If you find out a mistake during that period, put a Support ticket as soon as possible with high priority.

There is also second reason for the suppression period. Depending on the parallel processes run in your Marketing Cloud, the amount of contacts requested for deletion, as well as the volume of data in the system, SFMC Contact Deletion can be very time consuming process. Suppression makes sure that even if it takes longer than you would like, the Contact will not get any unwanted communication.

:::note You Should Know

There are few places that are not targeted by the out-of-the-box Marketing Cloud Contact Deletion process:

- Non-Sendable Data Extensions » _Can be removed with either retention or heavy custom scripting_
- Synchronized Data Extensions » _Can be removed in the source system_
- Triggered Send Lists » _Can be removed using [API method](#sfmc-api-contact-deletion)_

It also ignores any data that is not connected to the deleted contact by Contact Key / Subscriber Key / Contact ID, so be sure to have proper deduplication process in place for compliance.

:::

### Enable Contact Deletion

To be able to use Contact Deletion Process in Salesforce Marketing Cloud you have to enable it first. To do this, you need to have Marketing Cloud Administrator role.

1. Go to parent Business Unit.
2. Go to Audience Builder » Contact Builder.
3. Click Contacts Configuration in top menu.
4. Enable the process in the Contact Delete section.
5. Configure suppression period by clicking Manage Settings (default is 2 days).
6. Save.

If you want the Contact Deletion process to trigger automatically after you start it - set the suppression period to 0 days. It will be added to processing queue instantly after request.

:::note You Should Know

For the most popular SFMC tenant type - Enterprise 2.0 - the deletion must happen at the parent level and will be automatically applied across all Business Units.

If you have a different tenat type, check details in the official [documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_cab_contact_deletion.htm&type=5).

:::

### Manual Contact Deletion

Once the Contact Deletion is [enabled and configured](#enable-contact-deletion), you can start cleaning. The easiest way to do it is to leverage manual deletion options available in the Contact Builder.

:::note You Should Know

Manual Contact Deletion in Email Studio will remove the contact only from Email Studio. To trigger the Contact Deletion Process you must either leverage Contact Builder or [API method](#sfmc-api-contact-deletion).

:::

#### Delete contacts from All Contacts

This method is best if you have just few contacts you want to delete. It's simple, it's fast, it's very limited.

1. Go to parent Business Unit.
2. Go to Audience Builder » Contact Builder.
3. Click All Contacts in top menu.
4. Find a contact(s) you want to delete and click checkboxes next to them.
5. Click trash icon and select Delete selected contacts.

Using this method you can delete multiple contacts, but only from a single page of results. If you navigate to the next page of results, previously checked contacts will no longer be part of your selection.

If you want to remove more contacts, leverage the Data Extension method shared below.

#### Delete all contacts from List or Data Extension

This method will be better if you want to remove significant number of contacts once, but don't want the hassle of the most powerful [API method](#sfmc-api-contact-deletion).

1. Go to parent Business Unit.
2. Go to Audience Builder » Contact Builder.
3. Click All Contacts in top menu.
4. Without selecting any contact, click the trash icon.
5. Click Delete contacts from list / data extension depending on your needs.
6. Select the Sendable Data Extension used for Contact Deletion process.
7. Decide whether the Data Extension itself should stay in the system after the contacts are deleted.
8. Click Delete Contacts.
9. Review and confirm by clicking Delete.

:::note You Should Know

This method allows you to delete up to one million contacts per operation. If you want to remove more than that, you will have to run the above steps multiple times or leverage [contact deletion automation](#contact-deletion-with-automation Studio).

:::

### SFMC API Contact Deletion

Previous methods are nice, but they require manual triggering in Salesforce Marketing cloud each time you want to run Contact Deletion Process. There are however many use cases where you might want to trigger it automatically - for example from a different system responsible for managing privacy.

Thankfully, SFMC offers a solution for that as well with REST API. To implement it:

1. Create authentication endpoint with correct permissions with Installed Package
    1. Go to Setup.
    2. Within Platform Tools section roll out Apps and click Installed Packages.
    3. Click New in top right.
    4. Provide a meaningful name and description for your Installed Package.
    5. Add Component - API Integration.
    6. Select Server-to-Server integration type.
    7. Within Contacts section select Read and Write for List and Subscribers. Write is needed for Deletion. Read - for checking the deletion status.
    8. Click Save.
2. Copy Client Id, Client Secret and Client Base (the unique string in either of the API URIs that is between `https://` and api type).
3. Leverage the contact deletion endpoint in the solution of your choice: `https://CLIENT_BASE.rest.marketingcloudapis.com/contacts/v1/contacts/actions/delete`.

This single endpoint will allow you to trigger Contact Deletion process in three ways, by adding a query string at the end. All scenarios will use the same Method, Content Type and Authorization, but the endpoint and payload will be different:

- Method: POST
- Content Type: application/json
- Authorization: Bearer TOKEN

#### Contact Deletion by Contact ID

Endpoint: `https://CLIENT_BASE.rest.marketingcloudapis.com/contacts/v1/contacts/actions/delete?type=ids`
```json title="Delete by Contact ID Payload"
{
    "values": [1111111, 22222222],
    "deleteOperationType": "ContactAndAttributes"
}
```

The `values` for this endpoint is an array of Contact IDs (integers).

#### Contact Deletion by Contact Key

Endpoint: `https://CLIENT_BASE.rest.marketingcloudapis.com/contacts/v1/contacts/actions/delete?type=keys`

```json title="Delete by Contact Key Payload"
{
    "values": ["A1B2C3D4", "E5F6G7H8"],
    "deleteOperationType": "ContactAndAttributes"
}
```

The `values` for this endpoint is an array of Contact Keys (strings).

#### Contact Deletion using Data Extension

Endpoint: `https://CLIENT_BASE.rest.marketingcloudapis.com/contacts/v1/contacts/actions/delete?type=listReference`
```json title="Delete using Data Extension Payload"
{
    "deleteOperationType": "ContactAndAttributes",
    "targetList": {
        "listType": { "listTypeID": 3 },
        "listKey": "contactDeletionDEKey"
    },
    "deleteListWhenCompleted": false,
    "deleteListContentsWhenCompleted": true
    }
```

In this endpoint you have control over three values:

- `listKey`: the external key of the Data Extension you use for Contact Deletion process.
- `deleteListWhenCompleted`: when `true`, it will delete the Data Extension during Contact Deletion process.
- `deleteListContentsWhenCompleted`: when `true` it will delete records from the Data Extensions during Contact Deletion process.

### Contact Deletion with Automation Studio

With the [API Contact Deletion](#sfmc-api-contact-deletion) we are not limited to external triggers. We can also leverage AMPScript or SSJS to trigger it directly from Marketing Cloud.

The most popular use case for it is a Contact Deletion Automation that is scheduled to clean up the database on regular basis. It's great idea to keep your SFMC instance clean without much of a hassle.

My recommended approach is to create a dedicated Pending Contact Deletion Shared Data Extension that will store records to-be-deleted along with some context and remove it's content nightly with the Script Activity.

#### Pending Contact Deletion Data Extension

If you want to capture contacts-to-be-deleted from multiple Business Units, make it Shared Data Extension.

| Name | DataType | Default Value | Length | Nullable |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 🔑 SubscriberKey | Text | | 18 | No |
| DeletionReason | Text | | 50 | Yes |
| DeletionDate | Date | Current date | | Yes |

External Key: `contact-deletion-pending-de`
Sendable: `true`

For basic contact deletion you don't need anything but the Subscriber Key, however, I prefere to add a bit more context that I can leverage in the [Contact Deletion arhcive](#contact-deletion-archive) described later in this article.

#### Contact Deletion Script Activity

Below you can find ready-to-use SSJS snippet for Script Activity. Change `clietnSecret`, `clientID` and `clientBase` variables to data you saved during [Installed Package configuration](#sfmc-api-contact-deletion). If needed, change also the `contactDeletionDEKey`, `errorDE` and `automationName` variables to reflect your configuration.

To learn more about `errorDE` check my [debugging guide](../ssjs/debugging-ssjs.mdx#error-logging). You will find there also details about [helper functions](../ssjs/debugging-ssjs.mdx#error-handler-function) from the script.

### Monitor Contact Deletion Process

There are three ways to monitor what is happening with your Contact Deletion requesta (all should be performed from parent Business Unit):

1. In Contact Builder in top menu click All Contacts. Click the trash icon in top right and select __View Pending Deletions__.
2. In Contact Builder in top menu click Contact Analytics. You will see a full __Contact Deletion Dashboard__.
3. Request details using [__Contact Deletion Details API__](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/ContactsDeleteRequestsDetails.html).

----

## Which contacts should be deleted?

This question should be always aligned with the specific business needs of your company, however, there are some very popular segments that may inspire you.

You can add them within the same Automation as the [Contact Deletion Script Activity](#contact-deletion-script-activity) to make sure they are captured right before cleanup. You may also create separate Automations on your child Business Unit to capture a BU-specific candidates for cleanup using data available only there.

Remember to test those recommendations and queries (for example using [Query Studio](../sql/sfmc-sql-basics.mdx#query-studio)) before implementing them in your Contact Deletion Process, as even a small mistake might lead to irreversible data loss.

### Contacts deleted in Salesforce CRM

If you are using Marketing Cloud Connect to integrate your Salesforce CRM with the Marketing Cloud, you should definitely think about synchronizing deletions between those two systems. This does not happen automatically. By default, contacts deleted in SF CRM are removed only from Synchronized Data Extensions, but stay in all other tables of Marketing Cloud where they were added previously.

You can however easily

```sql title=""
SELECT
      subscriber.SubscriberKey
    , 'Deleted in SFID' AS DeletionReason
FROM _Subscribers AS subscriber
    LEFT JOIN Contact_Salesforce AS contact
        ON contact.Id = subscriber.SubscriberKey
WHERE contact.Id IS NULL
```

## Contact Deletion Archive

| Name | DataType | Default Value | Length | Nullable |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 🔑 SubscriberKey | Text | | 18 | No |
| HashedEmail | Text | | 254 | Yes |
| DeletionReason | Text | | 50 | Yes |
| FirstDeletionDate | Date | Current date | | Yes |
| LastDeletionDate | Date | | | No |

```sql
SELECT
      pending.SubscriberKey
    , CONVERT(NVARCHAR(128), HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', sub.EmailAddress), 2)    AS HashedEmail
    , pending.DeletionReason
    , pending.DeletionDate                                                  AS LastDeletionDate
    , pending.Source
FROM [contact-deletion-pending-de]   AS pending
    INNER JOIN _Subscribers                             AS sub
        ON sub.SubscriberKey = pending.SubscriberKey
```
