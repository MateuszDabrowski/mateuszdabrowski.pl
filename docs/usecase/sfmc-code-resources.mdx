## What are the Code Resources?

Code Resources in Salesforce Marketing Cloud are a solution for hosting JavaScript, CSS, JSON, RSS, Text and XML files within your account.

They were part of the legacy Classic Cloud Pages. However, their unique features and usefulness allowed them to survive sunsetting and thrive in the Web Studio. With Spring '22 Release they got a new home in Content Builder, and live along Content Blocks.

You may ask - why use Code Resources when we have new Cloud Pages in Web Studio and Code Content Blocks in Content Builder? As I highlighted above, a unique set of features makes Code Resources irreplaceable.
