I'm a huge fan of Tim Petter's [PEP20 - Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). In 19 short lines, he described his recommendations for writing beautiful Python code. THe outcome transcended the specific language and I see it as a very universal guide on software engineering.

In this article I share my Salesforce Marting Cloud adaptation and interpretation of this pearl. Expect minimal modifications to the original text (as most of the recommendations are perfectly valid for our Marketing Automation world), followed by my comments explaining how particular lines can be leveraged in SFMC practice.

## Zen of SFMC

```txt
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Naming conventions counts twice.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
Even when certain, test.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than right now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Documentation is one honking great idea - let's do more of those!
```

## Thoughts on Zen

Remember that those recommendations are just that - recommendations. Not strict rules, but rather a set of general principles that might help you in your day-to-day work with Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

### Beautiful is better than ugly.

Beauty might not be the thing that immediately come to mind, when talking about software development and implementation. It might also not be a focus in the world of short deadlines and evergrowing KPIs. However, one should not forget about beauty when deploying Marketing Cloud Solutions.

#### Code

When you are writing code in Salesforce Marketing Cloud - be it [AMPScript](../#ampscript), [SSJS](../#ssjs), [SQL](../#sql), or other - you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the structure and style. Random indentation, no new line, cryptic variables? All are possible.

But you should strive to not only write the code that works, but also make that code beautiful. It might take a bit longer to write, but it will make your code more readable, easier to debug and understandable to others.

```sql title="Both queries work - which one would you rather read?"
/* Beauty */
SELECT
      wel.SubscriberKey     AS SubscriberKey
    , wel.EmailAddress      AS EmailAddress
    , o.EventDate           AS OpenDate
FROM WelcomeCampaignSegment AS wel
    INNER JOIN _Open        AS o
        ON o.SubscriberKey = wel.SubscriberKey

/* and the Beast */
select a.subscriberkey, a.emailaddress, b.eventdate
from welcomecampaignsegment a join _open b on a.subscriberkey = b.subscriberkey

```

Looking for specific examples on how to make your code beautiful? Check my Style Guides for [AMPScript](../ampscript/ampscript-style-guide/), [SSJS](../ssjs/ssjs-style-guide/), [SQL](../sql/sfmc-sql-style-guide/),

#### Platform

The choice betweem beauty and ugly is not limited to writing the code. The same is true for working with Salesforce Marketing Cloud no-code tools.

Creating a Email Template using Blocks in Content Builder? Sure, you can just drag and drop the empty blocks in proper order and call it a day. But you can also put a bit more work and add sample content with predefined styles to each block, provide palceholder images with stated dimensions and save such elements as separate blocks that can be easily added in case more then one is needed.

Both approaches deliver the Email Template, but the second one does it in a beautiful way that makes using it easier and greatly improves value of the solution.
