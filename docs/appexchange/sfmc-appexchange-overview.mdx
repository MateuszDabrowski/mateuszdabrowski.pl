AppExchange is a Salesforce-owned app store for Salesforce platforms. You will find there Salesforce-built solutions (coming from Salesforce Labs) as well as 3rd party ones. Free and paid. Good and bad. But all - [validated by Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_guidelines.htm).

From over 4000 solutions available there, only around 60 are focused on core [Saleforce Marketing Cloud](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/category/marketing). I will be focusing only on solutions I had experience with, so that I can add some value over standard AppExchange descriptions and marketing materials.

:::note You Should Know

This document is a living thing. New solutions keep popping up, old ones sometimes disappear or are recreated. I try to keep it up-to-date, but your help with this task will be appreciated.
