AppExchange is an app store for various Clouds within Salesforce Customer 360 platform. You will find there both  in-house solutions coming from Salesforce Labs and 3rd party ones. Free and paid. Good and bad. But all - validated by [Salesforce Security Review](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_guidelines.htm).

From over 4000 solutions available there, only around 60 are for the [Saleforce Marketing Cloud](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/category/marketing). Here, I will be focusing only on those I had experience with to provide some value over the standard AppExchange descriptions and marketing materials.

:::note You Should Know

This document is a living thing. New solutions keep popping up, old ones sometimes disappear or are recreated. I try to keep it up-to-date, but your help with this task will be appreciated.

## When is AppExchange worth it?

Before we jump into specific solutions available in the store, let's talk whether you even should consider going through AppExchange offerings. This question is especially relevant with how feature-packed and customizable the Marketing Cloud is. And not that easy to answer when you consider all decision drivers.

### 1. Define feature requirements

Ok, you want some feature and are eager to find a solution that can deliver it. Now stop. Before opening the AppExchange repository you should first dive deep into what are the exact requirements the solution has to fulfil.

Key things to consider:
- What it needs to do - what is minimum valuable outcome and what is an ideal one?
- How it needs to do it - does it have to be user friendly no-code solution or is developer-oriented approach acceptable?
- Where it needs to do it - does it have to be done within the SFMC or can it be external?
- Who needs to do it - do you have resources to implement it or should it be outsourced?
- What is the budget - does it have to be free, cheap or you can pay for good value?

Those requirements should be aligned with the final users and be clear enough to serve as a guardrails for making informed decision.

### 2. Validate out-of-the-box solutions
