AppExchange is an app store for various Clouds within Salesforce Customer 360 platform. You will find there both  in-house solutions coming from Salesforce Labs and 3rd party ones. Free and paid. Good and bad. But all - validated by [Salesforce Security Review](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_guidelines.htm).

From over 4000 solutions available there, only around 60 are for the [Saleforce Marketing Cloud](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/category/marketing). Here, I will be focusing only on those I had experience with to provide some value over the standard AppExchange descriptions and marketing materials.

:::note You Should Know

This document is a living thing. New solutions keep popping up, old ones sometimes disappear or are recreated. I try to keep it up-to-date, but your help with this task will be appreciated.

## When is AppExchange worth it?

Before we jump into specific solutions available in the store, let's talk whether you even should consider going through AppExchange offerings. This question is especially relevant with how feature-packed and customizable the Marketing Cloud is. And not that easy to answer when you consider all decision drivers.

### 1. Define feature requirements

Ok, you want some feature and are eager to find a solution that can deliver it. Now stop. Before opening the AppExchange repository you should first dive deep into what are the exact requirements the solution has to fulfil.

Key things to consider:
- __What it needs to do__ - what is minimum valuable outcome and what is an ideal one?
- __How it needs to do it__ - does it have to be user friendly no-code solution or is developer-oriented approach acceptable?
- __Where it needs to do it__ - does it have to be done within the SFMC or can it be external?
- __Who needs to do it__ - do you have resources to implement it or should it be outsourced?
- __What is the budget__ - does it have to be free, cheap or you can pay for good value?

Those requirements should be aligned with the final users and be clear enough to serve as a guardrails for making informed decision.

### 2. Validate out-of-the-box options

One you have requirements, it's time to check what already is within your Marketing Cloud license. Over the years Salesforce baked in a lot of solutions, so you might find something already there, just waiting to be used.

:::note You Should Know

Not all solutions are available by default - some require a support ticket to be enabled. Check out my [list of features on-demand](../config/sfmc-config-features-on-demand.mdx) to see whether there is anything hidden that might fulfill your requirements.

:::

However, even if your requirement has an out-of-the-box solution, it doesn't always mean the end of the work. You need to check whether it is good and easy enough:

- __Good Enough__: Just because there is something, it might not fulfill all the requirements you gathered in the first step. Maybe it is to basic for your needs or doesn't have access to all data you want to leverage. This is where you start seeing benefits of the prework you did before.
- __Easy Enough__: Even if the solution is good enough, it might not be easy enough. Always assess the solution taking into consideration knowledge and skills of the end users - not yours (unless you will be the only end user, of course).

If the out-of-the-box solution checks both boxes - you hit a jackpot and can leverage what is alredy there.

Else, it's time to look somewhere... else.

### 3. Free AppExchange Solutions

Time to check whether there is any free solution available on demand. You can do it by going to [marketing AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/category/marketing) and applying filters to get Free solutions dedicated to Marketing Cloud.

To manage your expectations - for Salesforce Marketing Cloud the list won't be long and even then you have to make sure the app is truly offering a meaningful free tier. Expect free Salesforce Labs solutions (like [Query Studio](#query-studio) covered below) and little pearls made by 3rd parties - like Content Builder asset finder [DESelect Search](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000PFaZrEAL).

If you are lucky enough to find something free in AppExchange that is related to your requirements, be sure to check whether it is good enough. Just as you did in the [previous step](#2-validate-out-of-the-box-options).

No luck? Before checking the paid filter in AppExchange, there is one more approach to consider.

### 4. Custom Solution

A decade ago building custom solution for every requirement was all the rage. Since then the platforms and their 3rd party ecostystems has grown a lot, making this approach much less tempting. Why?

There are four things to consider:

1. __Can you buld a Custom solution?__ This can be done using in-house developers or outsourced to external specialists but you need either skills or budget.
2. __Will it be good enough?__ If you have the means, building a custom is easy. But do you have _enough_ skills or budget to build a good solution that will be user friendly, optimized, polished and matching all your requirements?
3. __Will it be cheaper then AppExchange?__ Sure, with enough time and money, you probably can build something good enough. But will it be cheaper then similar solution available in paid section of AppExchange?
4. __Will you maintain it?__ Even if you answered yes to previous three points, you need to take into account the maintenance. In most cases building a custom is just the beginning. Requirements change, new needs happen, platforms get updated and require refactor. With AppExchange solutions it _should_ be much less of a worry in the long term.

While the list might look like a hard pass for custom solutions, there is a place for them. Especially on the ends of the spectrum. Simple, but lifesaving micro solutions ([Cloud Page Apps](../usecase/sfmc-cloud-page-apps.mdx), [Code Resources](../usecase/sfmc-code-resource.mdx)) or custom behemots aligned to all non-negotiable quirks and features of your internal processes.

However, if you hit a hard "no" to any of the above questions, it's time to hit the AppExchange again.

### 5. Paid AppExchange Solutions

Here we are. After defining the requirements, we haven't found anything worthy among the out-of-the-box solutions, the land of the free AppExchange was bareen and the custom work didn't seem like the best choice. Paid AppExchange it is. But is it really?

Assuming you found a paid solution, you still need to assess whether it will be good enough. The good part here? If you see only small pieces missing from the ideal, you might talk with the solution creators and discuss prioritisation of the future changes.

However, you also need to keep in mind the budget. Not only the subscription cost, but also implementation, training, enhancements. After considering all of that - will you still see return on investment? If yes - you are good to go.

If not, it's time to update your requirements - be it the list of needed features or the size of the budget - and [start again](#2-validate-out-of-the-box-options).
