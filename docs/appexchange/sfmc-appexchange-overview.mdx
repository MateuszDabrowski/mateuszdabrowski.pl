AppExchange is an app store for various Clouds within Salesforce Customer 360 platform. You will find there both  in-house solutions coming from Salesforce Labs and 3rd party ones. Free and paid. Good and bad. But all - validated by [Salesforce Security Review](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_guidelines.htm).

From over 4000 solutions available there, only around 60 are for the [Saleforce Marketing Cloud](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/category/marketing). Here, I will be focusing only on those I had experience with to provide some value over the standard AppExchange descriptions and marketing materials.

This document is a living thing. New solutions keep popping up, old ones sometimes disappear or are recreated. I try to keep it up-to-date, but your help with this task will be appreciated.

## When is AppExchange worth it?

Before we jump into specific solutions available in the store, let's talk whether you even should consider going through AppExchange offerings. This question is especially relevant with how feature-packed and customizable the Marketing Cloud is. And not that easy to answer when you consider all decision drivers.

### 1. Define feature requirements

Ok, you want some feature and are eager to find a solution that can deliver it. Now stop. Before opening the AppExchange repository you should first dive deep into what are the exact requirements the solution has to fulfil.

Key things to consider:
- __What it needs to do__ - what is minimum valuable outcome and what is an ideal one?
- __How it needs to do it__ - does it have to be user friendly no-code solution or is developer-oriented approach acceptable?
- __Where it needs to do it__ - does it have to be done within the SFMC or can it be external?
- __Who needs to do it__ - do you have resources to implement it or should it be outsourced?
- __What is the budget__ - does it have to be free, cheap or you can pay for good value?

Those requirements should be aligned with the final users and be clear enough to serve as a guardrails for making informed decision.

### 2. Validate out-of-the-box options

One you have requirements, it's time to check what already is within your Marketing Cloud license. Over the years Salesforce baked in a lot of solutions, so you might find something already there, just waiting to be used.

:::note You Should Know

Not all solutions are available by default - some require a support ticket to be enabled. Check out my [list of features on-demand](./config/sfmc-config-features-on-demand.mdx) to see whether there is anything hidden that might fulfill your requirements.

:::

However, even if your requirement has an out-of-the-box solution, it doesn't always mean the end of the work. You need to check whether it is good and easy enough:

- __Good Enough__: Just because there is something, it might not fulfill all the requirements you gathered in the first step. Maybe it is to basic for your needs or doesn't have access to all data you want to leverage. This is where you start seeing benefits of the prework you did before.
- __Easy Enough__: Even if the solution is good enough, it might not be easy enough. Always assess the solution taking into consideration knowledge and skills of the end users - not yours (unless you will be the only end user, of course).

If the out-of-the-box solution checks both boxes - you hit a jackpot and can leverage what is alredy there.

Else, it's time to look somewhere... else.

### 3. Free AppExchange Solutions

Time to check whether there is any free solution available on demand. You can do it by going to [marketing AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/category/marketing) and applying filters to get Free solutions dedicated to Marketing Cloud.

To manage your expectations - for Salesforce Marketing Cloud the list won't be long and even then you have to make sure the app is truly offering a meaningful free tier. Expect free Salesforce Labs solutions (like [Query Studio](#query-studio) covered below) and little pearls made by 3rd parties - like Content Builder asset finder [DESelect Search](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000PFaZrEAL).

If you are lucky enough to find something free in AppExchange that is related to your requirements, be sure to check whether it is good enough. Just as you did in the [previous step](#2-validate-out-of-the-box-options).

No luck? Before checking the paid filter in AppExchange, there is one more approach to consider.
