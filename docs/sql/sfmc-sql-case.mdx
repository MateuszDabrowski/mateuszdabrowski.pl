## Conditional values with CASE

`CASE` statement evaluates a list of conditions and returns one of the multiple possible result expressions. For Marketing Cloud purposes, it is especially useful when you want to select a column and modify the values within it. Perfect for translating numeric codes to descriptive ones for personalisation purposes. Excellent for standardising data (change those `1`, `true` and `on` values of opt-in to a single format).

```sql {8-14}
SELECT
      ContactKey
    , EmailAddress
    , [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId
    , Gender__c             AS Gender
    , 'Lead'                AS RecordType
    , GETUTCDATE()          AS ImportDate
    , CASE MemberType__c
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
      END
```

You can have as many `WHEN`/`THEN` conditions as you want. Also, the `ELSE` statement is optional but a good idea to catch unexpected values.

Feel free also to leverage [aliases](./sfmc-sql-select.mdx#aliasing-with-as) to manipulate the column name at the same time:

```sql {14}
SELECT
      ContactKey
    , EmailAddress
    , [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId
    , Gender__c             AS Gender
    , 'Lead'                AS RecordType
    , GETUTCDATE()          AS ImportDate
    , CASE MemberType__c
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
      END                   AS MemberType
```

### Search version of CASE

The above examples are already helpful in segmentation, but there is also one more way to write and use a `CASE` statement that gives even more power. The search `CASE`.

The difference is that you are not passing the column name on which you will be building conditions. Instead, you create a boolean expression from scratch for each scenario.

```sql {8-14} title="The same query as the previous one, but written with Search Case"
SELECT
      ContactKey
    , EmailAddress
    , [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId
    , Gender__c             AS Gender
    , 'Lead'                AS RecordType
    , GETUTCDATE()          AS ImportDate
    , CASE
        WHEN MemberType__c = 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
      END                   AS MemberType
```

The example above doesn't show why it is worth using the search `CASE`. It is a bit longer than the standard approach! But there is a reason to use this form of `CASE` statement that is visible once you want to create more elaborate conditions that are possible only with this version:

```sql {3-7} title="Let's calculate what channel we should use in our campaign for a given user"
SELECT
      ContactKey
    , CASE
        WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1                             THEN 'Push'
        WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL    THEN 'Email'
        WHEN PhoneOptIn = 1 AND Mobile IS NOT NULL          THEN 'Phone'
      END AS PreferredChannel
```

:::note You Should Know

`CASE` statement returns `THEN` value of the first condition that evaluated to `TRUE`. In the above example, if the `IsAppInstalled = 1` is true, other conditions are not considered. Even if for selected contact all of them will be true, it will still have the value `Push` in PreferredChannel. It is perfect, as it allows us to prioritise cheaper channels.

Always consider the order of the conditions in your `CASE` statement. It both might lead to errors if you don't expect the behaviour mentioned above and make your life much easier if you know it works that way.

:::

As you can see, thanks to search `CASE` statements, we can check conditions on multiple different columns and connect them with `AND`/`OR` statements for better control. You can use this version of the `CASE` statement for all your needs (even those covered by the basic one) to not worry about two ways of formatting.

:::note You Should Know

You can use `CASE` statements inside a `CASE` statement to have an even more dynamic query.

```sql {3-16} title="Let's add another dimension of membership level to differentiate available channels"
SELECT
      ContactKey
    , CASE
        WHEN MemberType = 'Platinum'                        THEN 'Key Account Manager'
        WHEN MemberType = 'Gold' OR MemberType = 'Silver'   THEN
            CASE
                WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1                             THEN 'Push'
                WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL    THEN 'Email'
                WHEN PhoneOptIn = 1 AND Mobile IS NOT NULL          THEN 'Phone'
            END
        WHEN MemberType = 'Bronze'                          THEN
            CASE
                WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1                             THEN 'Push'
                WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL    THEN 'Email'
            END
      END AS PreferredChannel
```

### LIKE in CASE

[`LIKE`](./sfmc-sql-like.mdx) is not only valuable for the [`WHERE` Statement](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#like-operator). It is also an incredible tool empowering the `CASE` statement. It allows you to build flexible conditions on free text values:

```sql {4} title="Great way to split your database between Internal and External users for different communication"
SELECT
      ContactKey
    , CASE
        WHEN EmailAddress LIKE '%@mateuszdabrowski.%' THEN 'Internal'
        ELSE 'External'
      END AS ContactType
```

In the `SELECT` statement, the `LIKE` operator is handy for fixing data coming from the free text fields. To learn more about the possibilities, check out the [`LIKE` guide](./sfmc-sql-like.mdx).

### IIF Shorthand

The `CASE` statement is a fantastic tool but can be overkill for simple conditions. The `IIF` comes to the rescue.

It takes three arguments:

1. Condition
2. The value returned if the condition evaluates to true
3. The value returned if the condition evaluates to false

With it, instead of multiline `CASE`:

```sql {3-6}
SELECT
      _Subscriber.SubscriberKey
    , CASE
        WHEN _Subscriber.Status = 'active' THEN 'TRUE'
        ELSE 'FALSE'
      END AS Sendable
```

You can have the same outcome in a single, more readable `IIF` line:

```sql {3}
SELECT
      _Subscriber,SubscriberKey,
    , IIF(_Subscriber.Status = 'active', 'TRUE', 'FALSE') AS Sendable
```

Whenever you have a single condition - go with `IIF`.

:::note You Should Know

You can take both `CASE` and `IIF` to the next level with dynamic values. Don't limit yourself to a string, integer or boolean - pass a column name.

Use case? Think of a Master Data Extension that stores a massive amount of contact information, including preferred channel (Email or Mobile). With dynamic values and `IIF` in just a few lines, we can create an optimised Data Extension with crucial information:

```sql {4}
SELECT
      SubscriberKey
    , PreferredChannel
    , IIF(PreferredChannel = 'Email', EmailAddress, MobileNumber) AS PointOfContact
```

Now, even with just three columns in your Entry Point, you can create a Journey that adapts the channel to customer preferences.

## CASE in WHERE

The `CASE` statement is not only useful in a [`SELECT`](./sfmc-sql-select.mdx) part of the query. You can use it also within the [`WHERE` to apply conditional filtering](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#case-operator).
