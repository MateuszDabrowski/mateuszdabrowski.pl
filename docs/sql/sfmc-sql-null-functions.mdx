NULL is a fickle beast and for the people not accustomed with how it works in SQL it can create a lot of problems (read: incorrect data output). This is especially true for those coming from nullish-friendly languages (like SSJS). Let's jump into the details.

## NULL

Like in other languages, `NULL` marks an empty value. Unlike in (some) other languages (like SSJS), it can be used in any data type. You can have `NULL` Date (datetime) , `NULL` Number (int), `NULL` Text (nvarchar) or `NULL` Boolean.

Also unlike in (some) other languages, SQL doesn't support a default nullish coalescing. In simpler words, it means that empty string (`''`) or zero (`0`) are not equal to `NULL`.
