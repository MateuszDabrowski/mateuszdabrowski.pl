NULL is a fickle beast, and for the people not accustomed to how it works in SQL, it can create many problems (read: incorrect data output). This is especially true for those coming from nullish-friendly languages (like SSJS). Let's jump into the details.

## NULL

Like in other languages, NULL is a placeholder that marks an absent (unknown) value. Unlike in other languages (like SSJS), it can be used in any data type. You can have `NULL` Date (datetime) , `NULL` Number (int), `NULL` Text (nvarchar) or `NULL` Boolean.

Also, unlike in some other languages, SQL doesn't support a _default_ nullish coalescing. In simpler words, it means that empty string (`''`) or zero (`0`) are not equal to `NULL`. It makes sense when you treat `NULL` as an unknown value - unknown is not equal to `0`.

### NULL with standard SQL Functions

Because `NULL` is unknown, if you try to do any standard operation on the NULL (like adding an integer, or [concatenating](./sfmc-sql-string-functions.mdx#concat) it with a string), it will return unknown (`NULL`):

```sql {2-3} title="❌ Functions with NULLs"
SELECT
      1 + NULL               AS MathFunctionWithNull    -- Outputs NULL
    , CONCAT('Hello ', NULL) AS StringFunctionWithNull  -- Outputs NULL
```

### NULL with relational operators

The fun doesn't stop there - When you try to make any [comparision](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#basic-operators) with `NULL`, it will fail, because it is a check against an unknown value. Or, to be more specific, the comparison will evaluate to `FALSE`, impacting your output.

```sql {4-6} title="❌ Comparisons with NULLs"
SELECT SubscriberKey
FROM DataExtension
WHERE
    NullablePurchaseCount > 0
    AND NullableProductName != 'T-Shirt'
    AND EmailAddress != NULL
```

In the example above, all three comparisons in the [`WHERE`](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx) statement will return `FALSE` for `NULL`s and the query will not output any rows.

Let's check why, step by step:

1. `NullablePurchaseCount > 0` - The rows with a value (be it `0` or `10`) are evaluated normally. The rows with `NULL` (absent value) evaluate as `FALSE` and are removed from the output.
2. `NullableProductName != 'T-Shirt'` - The rows with a value (be it `''`, `'Hoodie'` or `'T-Shirt'`) are evaluated normally. The rows with `NULL` (absent value) evaluate as `FALSE` and are removed from the output.
3. `EmailAddress != NULL` - Regardless of the `EmailAddress` value, because we are comparing it to `NULL`, check for every row evaluate to `FALSE` and therefore is dropped from the output.

### NULL with conditional operators

`NULL` gets even more problematic when you want to work with [`IN`/`NOT IN`](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#in-shorthand) or [`BETWEEN`/`NOT IN BETWEEN`](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#between-shorthand).

When you use `NULL` as one of the values searched by `IN` shorthand, it will be ignored, and no rows with `NULL` in the checked column will be outputted for this condition.

When you use `NULL` with the other shorthands (`NOT IN`, `BETWEEN` and `NOT IN BETWEEN`), this condition will have no results.

### NULL with logical operators

When you are building a boolean logic with `AND`/`OR` operators (be it in [`WHERE`](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx) or in [`CASE`](./sfmc-sql-case.mdx)) treat `NULL` as `FALSE`.

#### AND operator

When you have two booleans or expressions connected by the `AND` operator, it will only evaluate to `TRUE` if both are `TRUE`.

Boolean or Expression | Boolean or Expression | Result
- | - | -
TRUE | TRUE | __TRUE__
TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
TRUE | NULL | NULL
FALSE | TRUE | FALSE
FALSE | FALSE | FALSE
FALSE | NULL | NULL
NULL | TRUE | NULL
NULL | FALSE | NULL
NULL | NULL | NULL

#### OR operator

When you have two booleans or expressions connected by the `OR` operator, it will evaluate to `TRUE` if at least one is `TRUE`.

Boolean or Expression | Boolean or Expression | Result
- | - | -
TRUE | TRUE | __TRUE__
TRUE | FALSE | __TRUE__
TRUE | NULL | __TRUE__
FALSE | TRUE | __TRUE__
FALSE | FALSE | FALSE
FALSE | NULL | NULL
NULL | TRUE | __TRUE__
NULL | FALSE | NULL
NULL | NULL | NULL

### NULL with aggregate functions

[Aggregate functions](./sfmc-sql-aggregate-functions.mdx) just ignore `NULL` values. Calculating average? `NULL` will not be taken into consideration at all - which can scew your output a lot.

The only exception is [`COUNT`](./sfmc-sql-aggregate-functions.mdx#count) that has specific `*` argument for counting rows with `NULL`.

Ok, we discussed a lot of `NULL` problems. Now it's time to solve them with dedicated `NULL` functions.

## IS NULL

Firstly, let's cover how we can recognize whether a `NULL` is a `NULL`. Using standard `=`/`!=` operators won't work, but you can do it easily with dedicated `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL` operators:

```sql {3} title="Subscribers with Email Address"
SELECT SubscriberKey
FROM DataExtension
WHERE EmailAddress IS NOT NULL
```

Because comparison operators don't work, if you are building filters on nullable values, you might have to query defensively:

```sql {5} title="Subscribers with small amount of purchases"
SELECT SubscriberKey
FROM DataExtension
WHERE
    PurchaseCount < 5
    OR PurchaseCount IS NULL
```

Assuming `PurchaseCount` is a nullable field, should you use only `PurchaseCount < 5`, you wouldn't see the rows with the `NULL` in that column. Adding another condition that checks explicitly for `NULL` solves that.

However, there are other methods - dedicated shorthands of the universally helpful [`CASE`](./sfmc-sql-case.mdx) statement. Let's check them.

## ISNULL

`ISNULL` function is the first line of defence against the `NULL`s. It takes two arguments, checks the first one, and returns it if it is not `NULL`. Else, it returns the second. Perfect for creating a fallback value for nullable columns.

```sql {3} title="Subscribers with small amount of purchases"
SELECT SubscriberKey
FROM DataExtension
WHERE ISNULL(PurchaseCount, 0) < 5
```

Now the filter will check whether `PurchaseCount` is `NULL`. If not, it will use its value. If yes, it will consider it a zero for the conditional check.

The second argument doesn't have to be a standard value. It can also be a column. Just make sure it is not nullable, or...

## COALESCE

If a single fallback provided by `ISNULL` is not enough, the `COALESCE` function lets you provide multiple. `COALESCE` will return the first argument that is not `NULL`. However, if all are `NULL` - the final outcome will also be `NULL`.

```sql {3,5} title="Find Subscribers with at least one available address for a direct mail"
SELECT
      SubscriberKey
    , COALESCE(HomeAddress, WorkAddress, ParentAddress) AS AvailableAddress
FROM DataExtension
WHERE COALESCE(HomeAddress, WorkAddress, ParentAddress) IS NOT NULL
```

:::note You Should Know

`COALESCE` is perfect for creating concatenated fields where you are not sure if all parts will be available, as it lets you control the number of spaces between elements:

```sql title="Calculate FullName with nullable MiddleName"
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', COALESCE(MiddleName + ' ', ''), LastName) AS FullName
```

:::

## NULLIF

Finally, there is the `NULLIF` function that returns `NULL` if two provided arguments are equal or the first argument if they are different:

```sql {4} title="Pulls WorkEmailAddress value only if it is different from general EmailAddress"
SELECT
      SubscriberKey
    , EmailAddress
    , NULLIF(WorkEmailAddress, EmailAddress) AS WorkEmailAddress
```

I personally find the standard [`IIF`](./sfmc-sql-case.mdx#iif-shorthand) shorthand much more readable and user-friendly, despite being slightly longer than dedicated `NULLIF`:

```sql {4} title="Pulls WorkEmailAddress value only if it is different from general Email Address with IIF"
SELECT
      SubscriberKey
    , EmailAddress
    , IIF(WorkEmailAddress = EmailAddress, NULL, EmailAddress) AS WorkEmailAddress
```
