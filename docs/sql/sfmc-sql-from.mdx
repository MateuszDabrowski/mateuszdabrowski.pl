The `SELECT` statement alone won't do anything. Once you have selected columns you want to work with, you need also to pick the table (Data Extension or System Data View) from which those columns should be taken. The code for this is simple:

```sql {4}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
FROM MasterSubscriberDE
```

Just as with column names, if the name of your Data Extension has spaces in it, be sure to enclose it in brackets.

```sql {4}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
FROM [Master Subscriber DE]
```

There are, however, two cases, specific to Salesforce Marketing Cloud, that adds a twist. System Data Views and Enterprise Data Extensions.

## System Data Views

[System Data Views](sfmc-sql-system-data-views.mdx) are partially hidden Data Extensions used by the Salesforce Marketing Cloud to store data. Thing about Email Sent history, Opens and Clicks, Bounces and Complaints. You can find there also tracking data for SMS and Social channels. Also more technical data points, like Jobs and Enterprise Attributes, are using System Data Views. The difference related to those tables is in naming convention. When querying them you must leverage `_` prefix:

```sql {8}
SELECT
    JobID,
    EmailID,
    EmailName,
    EmailSubject,
    EmailSendDefinition,
    DeliveredTime
FROM _Job
```

## Enterprise Data Extension

If you want to query Shared Data Extensions or Synchronized Data Extensions you must use different special prefix, `ENT.`:

```sql {4}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
FROM ENT.SharedSegment
```

Remember that account permissons restrictions may apply.

:::note You Should Know

In some scenarios you might want to use both above options in the same time. For example, if you query System Data View _Subscribers on child Business Unit, you will receive data only for the subscribers stored in this child. In case you want to query all your subscribers, you should point to Enterprise level System Data View:

```sql {6}
SELECT
    SubscriberKey,
    EmailAddress,
    DateJoined,
    DateUnsubscribed
FROM ENT._Subscribers
```

:::

When selecting Data Extensions to pull data from, remember about a best practice to avoid ones spanning a cumulative field width greater than 4000 characters. They will badly impact performance of your query. If needed, consider splitting your query into multiple consecutive queries.
