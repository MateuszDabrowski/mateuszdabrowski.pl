Salesforce Marketing Cloud SQL implementation does not support user-defined functions. There are, however, multiple built-in functions that are useful on a day-to-day basis when working with queries.

Here, I will cover only selected date functions, that I find most useful for Marketing Automation purposes. They will help you find the current date, calculate a new one or format it to match your needs.

## GETDATE & GETUTCDATE

The `GETDATE` function is the most straightforward way to get current timestamp within your query.

```sql {2}
SELECT
    GETDATE() as CurrentDate
```

:::note You Should Know

`GETDATE()` gets server time. For Salesforce Marketing Cloud it means Central Standard Time (UTC-6) without changes between standard and daylight savings time. It cannot be changed, even with timezone and culture settings in Setup.

You can get the datetime with apprioriate offset information by using `SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()` function. It will return the same datetime as `GETDATE()` but in a format showcasing the timezone offset: `2020-12-28 15:08:01.7239173 -06:00`.

Not only you can see the 24-hour clock format, but also miliseconds and UTC-6 offset at the end. This last information will be useful for timezone conversions with [`AT TIME ZONE`](#at-time-zone) function.

You can also leverage [`TODATETIMEOFFSET'](#at-time-zone-vs-todatetimeoffset) to work with standard `GETDATE`.

:::

The `GETUTCDATE` function works the same as `GETDATE` but returns datetime in UTC timezone.

```sql {2}
SELECT
    GETUTCDATE() as CurrentUTCDate
```

Both return a datetime object (for example `Oct 30 2020 1:15AM`), so no conversion is needed to use other Date Functions on the outcome of this function.

You can, however, limit its output to either only date or time part by using [`CONVERT`](./sfmc-sql-conversion-functions.mdx#case--convert) or [`FORMAT`](#format-with-dates) Functions.

## DATEADD

The `DATEADD` functions give you the power to add and subtract from your date values.

```sql {2-3} title="Add seven days to current UTC date"
SELECT
    GETUTCDATE() AS TrialStartDate,
    DATEADD(DAY, 7, GETUTCDATE()) as TrialEndDate
```

It requires three things:

1. Date part - The date element that will be changed
2. Number - The integer (or an expression evaluating to integer) for interval
3. Date - The original date that will be changed by the `DATEADD` function. It can be in any date data type. The output will be of the same type.

`DATEADD` is especially useful when used with the [`WHERE`](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx) statement, as it allows to filter records dynamically:

```sql {5} title="Find all Subscribers that joined within the last month"
SELECT
    SubscriberKey,
    EmailAddress
FROM ENT._Subscribers
WHERE DateJoined >= DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())
```

:::note You Should Know

`DATEADD` does not take into consideration timezone offset.

However, if you are changing the date with 31st day of the month by months and the outcome month is shorter, SQL will account for that and return the last day of a given month.

### Date parts

You can reference date parts both by its full name, as well as an abbreviation.

| Date part | Abbreviations |
| -- | -- |
| YEAR | yy, yyyy |
| QUARTER | qq, q |
| MONTH | mm, m |
| DAYOFYEAR | dy, y |
| DAY | dd, d |
| WEEK | wk, ww |
| WEEKDAY | dw, w |
| HOUR | hh |
| MINUTE | mi, n |
| SECOND | ss, s |
| MILLISECOND | ms |
| MICROSECOND | mcs |
| NANOSECOND | ns |

`DAYOFYEAR`, `DAY`, and `WEEKDAY` are considered the same date part and return the equal value.

For 99% of SFMC needs, you will be just fine with `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR` and `MINUTE`. Using only those with the full name will make your queries readable and straightforward for everyone.

:::note You Should Know

Very similar date calculation is also available with `DATEADD()` AMPScript function. Depending on the use case, consider whether you want to manipulate the date in the Data Extension or only in the communication.

## AT TIME ZONE

The `AT TIME ZONE` function provides two awesome features:

1. It can provide timezone offset information for any datetime missing this data
2. It can convert datetime with offset across timezones

It's must have for multi-country senders, but also beneficial for others that are planning to personalize or calculate using date data.

### Adding offset with AT TIME ZONE

When you work with timezones, you want to have offset for the datetime fields you are using. Unfortunately, in most cases, you will not have it. Neither Salesforce Marketing Cloud system timestamps, nor the most popular [`GETDATE`](#getdate--getutcdate) function does not provide offset information.

This can be easily fixed with `AT TIME ZONE`. When you apply this function to a timezone-less datetime data, it will assume that you are defining it and return datetime with appropriate offset.

```sql {2-5} title="Daylight Saving Time magic"
SELECT
    CONVERT(DATETIME2(0), '2020-01-01T18:00:00') AT TIME ZONE 'Central Standard Time' AS CST,
    -- Output: 2020-01-01 18:00:00 -06:00
    CONVERT(DATETIME2(0), '2020-07-01T18:00:00') AT TIME ZONE 'Central Standard Time' AS CDT
    -- Output: 2020-07-01 18:00:00 -05:00
```

In the above snippet, we [`CONVERT`](./sfmc-sql-conversion-functions.mdx#convert) the dates to datetime without offset. Then the `AT TIME ZONE` function not only adds the offset - it also calculates the Daylight Saving Time offset change for you.

### AT TIME ZONE vs TODATETIMEOFFSET

As awesome as it might seem, taking Daylight Saving Time into consideration is actually a problem when working with Salesforce Marketing Cloud system dates (including the [`GETDATE`](#getdate--getutcdate)).

I say this because Salesforce Marketing Cloud uses Central Standard Time (UTC-6) __without__ changes between standard and daylight savings time. This means that the excellent feature of `AT TIME ZONE` is actually working against us.

There is however another function that might solve this issue - `TODATETIMEOFFSET`. It is simplified version of the `AT TIME ZONE` that adds arbitrary offset without doing any logic on Daylight Saving Time. Just as we would like for SFMC system dates.

To use it, just provide a datetime and an offset (for example `'-06:00'` or `'+00:00'`):

```sql {2-5} title="No Daylight Saving Time magic"
    TODATETIMEOFFSET(CONVERT(DATETIME2(0), '2020-01-01T18:00:00'), '-06:00') AS CST,
    -- Output: 2020-01-01 18:00:00 -06:00
    TODATETIMEOFFSET(CONVERT(DATETIME2(0), '2020-07-01T18:00:00'), '-06:00') AS AlsoCST,
    -- Output: 2020-07-01 18:00:00 -06:00
```

Of course, for any datetime values that include the Daylight Saving Time pushed from website or your data warehouse, [`AT TIME ZONE`](#adding-offset-with-at-time-zone) will be better solution.

### Changing timezone with AT TIME ZONE

`AT TIME ZONE` is useful also for changing the timezone of a datetime with offset.

```sql {2-3} title="Change CST datetime with offset to CET"
SELECT
    CONVERT(DATETIMEOFFSET(0), '2018-01-01 18:00:00 -06:00') AT TIME ZONE 'Central European Standard Time' AS CSTtoCET
    -- Output: 2020-01-01 01:00:00 +01:00
```

## FORMAT with Dates

The `FORMAT` works only with datetime and numeric values, outputs a string and requires:

1. Value to be formatted (can be a column, string or a function)
2. Format specifier to be applied
3. Optionally - ISO culture code

It is a perfect tool to manipulate any dates (or date-like strings with the help of [conversion](./sfmc-sql-conversion-functions.mdx)) available in your Data Extensions. For personalization. For comparison between system and imported dates outside of the query. For preparing data to export it to an external system with specific format requirements.

```sql {2-4} title="Instead of creating complex AMPScript logic to adapt dates, format them"
SELECT
    FORMAT(CONVERT(DATE, '10/30/2020'), 'd', 'en-GB') AS DateOrderedProperly,
    FORMAT(GETUTCDATE(), 'dd/MM/yyyy') AS TodayCustomFormat,
    FORMAT(DateJoined, 'D', 'de-DE') AS DateExpandedIndian

```

In the example above, the first two `FORMAT` functions return date in the same format - `30/10/2020` - one by using manually provided value, another by taking the current UTC date from the function.

The last line outputs `Freitag, 7. Februar 2020`. Neat for running it with [`CASE`](./sfmc-sql-select.mdx#conditional-values-with-case) to change your short date into an extended date personalized on user language.

### Standard date formats

Above, you have seen three different format specifiers used to manipulate the date, but there are much more available. You can find the most useful below:

| Format specifier | Description | Example (for US culture) |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 'd' | Short date | 10/30/2020 |
| 'D' | Long date | Friday, October 30, 2020 |
| 'm'/'M' | Month Day | October 30 |
| 'y'/'Y' | Year Month | October 2020 |
| 't' | Short time | 2:15 PM |
| 'T' | Long time | 2:15:30 PM |
| 'g' | General short time | 10/30/2020 2:15 PM |
| 'G' | General long time | 10/30/2020 2:15:30 PM |
| 'f' | Full short time | Friday, October 30, 2020 2:15 PM |
| 'F' | Full long time | Friday, October 30, 2020 2:15:30 PM |
| 'r'/'R' | RFC1123 | Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:15:30 GMT |

Just as highlighted in the table header - the examples are for the SFMC default US culture formating. If you add specific culture code as a third parameter, the outcome will be different, as various countries have different defaults of elements order and separator style.

You can find the full list of standard date format specifiers on [Microsoft .Net Doc Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).

### Custom date formats

Of course, you are not limited to the formats shown above. Whenever you want something different, you can create custom format by just providing full pattern instead of short specifier by using those elements:

| Format specifier | Description | Example (for US culture) |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 'd' | Day of the month | 1 |
| 'dd' | Zero-based day of the month | 01 |
| 'ddd' | Abbreviated day of the month | Mon |
| 'dddd' | Full day of the month | Monday |
| 'M' | Month | 1 |
| 'MM' | Zero-based month | 01 |
| 'MMM' | Abbreviated month | Jan |
| 'MMMM' | Full month | January |
| 'yy' | Last two digits of the year | 20 |
| 'yyyy' | Four digits year | 2020 |
| 'h' | Hour (12-hour clock) | 1 |
| 'hh' | Zero-based hour (12-hour clock) | 01 |
| 'tt' | AM/PM designator | AM |
| 'H' | Hour (24-hour clock) | 13 |
| 'HH' | Zero-based hour (24-hour clock) | 01 |
| 'm' | Minute | 1 |
| 'mm' | Zero-based minute | 01 |
| 's' | Seconds | 1 |
| 'ss' | Zero-based seconds | 01 |
| ':' | Time separator | ':' |
| '/' | Date separator | '/' |

Again, the examples are for the default US culture formatting and might look different for different cultures (for example, hour separator might be changed automatically to `.` for Italy).

You can use the above format specifiers to obtain the exact format needed:

```sql {2}
SELECT
    FORMAT(GETUTCDATE(), 'dddd (dd MMMM yyyy) - HH:mm', 'en-GB') AS FormattedDate
```

Above query will return `Saturday (30 October 2020) - 02:15`.

You can find the full list of custom date format specifiers on [Microsoft .Net Doc Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings).

AMPScript uses very similar custom formatting with `FORMAT()` and `FORMATDATE()` functions. Depending on the use case, consider whether you want to manipulate the date visual representation in the Data Extension or only in the communication.
