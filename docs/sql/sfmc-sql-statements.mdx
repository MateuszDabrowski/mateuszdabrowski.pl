## Select

`SELECT` statement opens each query. It both defines the columns of data extensions and system data views that will be needed, as well as allows you to create completly new data points.

The simplest version of this statement is `SELECT *`, which targets all available columns from the source. It is not recommended approach. Bad for both readability and performance of your query. This is why [Query Studio](sfmc-sql-basics.mdx#query-studio) does not support this shortcut.

The prefered method is targeting columns explicitly by their names:

```sql
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddres
```

If a column name contains a space, you need to capture it with squared brackets:

```sql {4}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddres,
    [External Contact Id]
```

### Labels

You can also utilize `SELECT` as a tool to rename the source columns to match your needs in outcome data extension. It is especially useful, when you are pulling the data from Synchronized Data Extension with names coming from Salesforce custom fields.

```sql {4-5}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender
```

### New values

Labels are also used for passing new values directly from your query. Need to add a custom string to outcome data extension? Or maybe synchonization timestamp for debugging purposes? You can leverage SQL for it.

```sql {6} title="Add custom column labaled 'ImportDate' with value equal to the UTC time of the script execution for each record"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender,
    GETUTCDATE() AS ImportDate
```

### Conditions

`CASE` statement evaluates a list of conditions and returns one of multiple possible result expressions. For Marketing Cloud purposes it is especially useful when you not only want to select a column, but also modify the values within it. Perfect for translating numeric codes to descriptive ones for personalization purposes. Awesome for standarizing data (change those `1`, `true` and `on` values of opt-in to a single format).

```sql {7-13}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender,
    GETUTCDATE() AS ImportDate,
    CASE MemberType__c
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
    END
```

You can also leverage [labels](#labels) to also manipulate the column name at the same time:

```sql {13}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender,
    GETUTCDATE() AS ImportDate,
    CASE MemberType__c
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
    END AS MemberType
```

Above examples are already useful in segmentation, but there is also one more way to write and use `CASE` statement that gives even more power. The search `CASE`.

The difference is that you are not passign the column name on which you will be building conditions. Instead, you create boolean expression from scratch for each scenario.

```sql {7-13} title="The same Query as the previous one, but written with Search Case"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender,
    GETUTCDATE() AS ImportDate,
    CASE
        WHEN MemberType__c = 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
    END AS MemberType
```

The example above doesn't show why it is worth to use the search `CASE`. It is actually a bit longer than the standard approach! But there is a reason to use this form of `CASE` statement that is visible once you want to create more elaborate conditions that are possible only with this version:

```sql {3-7} title="Lets calculate what channel we should use in our campaign for a given user"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    CASE
        WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1 THEN 'Push'
        WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL THEN 'Email'
        WHEN PhoneOptIn = 1 AND Mobile IS NOT NULL THEN 'Phone'
    END AS PrefferedChannel
```

As you can see, thanks to search `CASE` statement we were able to check conditions on multiple different columns and connect them with `AND`/`OR` statements for better control. You can use this version of the `CASE` statement for all your needs (even those covered by the basic one) to worry not about two ways of formatting.

:::note You Should Know
You can use `CASE` statements inside a `CASE` statement to have even more dynamic query.

```sql {3-16} title="Lets add another dimension of membership level to differentiate available channels"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    CASE
        WHEN MemberType = 'Platinum' THEN 'Key Account Manager'
        WHEN MemberType = 'Gold' OR MemberType = 'Silver' THEN
            CASE
                WHEN PhoneOptIn = 1 AND Mobile IS NOT NULL THEN 'Phone'
                WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL THEN 'Email'
                WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1 THEN 'Push'
            END
        WHEN MemberType = 'Bronze' THEN
            CASE
                WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL THEN 'Email'
                WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1 THEN 'Push'
            END
    END AS PrefferedChannel
```

### Flow control

Despite official [SFMC SQL documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_as_sql_reference.htm&type=5) states that it supports the `IF` constructs, I was not able to make it work.

### Variables & Functions

Unfortunately, SFMC SQL does not support variables.

Fortunately, it does support functions. Learn more about them in [SFMC SQL Functions documentation](sfmc-sql-functions.mdx).

## From

The `SELECT` statement alone won't do anything. Once you have selected columns you want to work with, you need also to pick the table (Data Extension or System Data View) from which those columns should be taken. The code for this is simple:

```sql {4}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
FROM MasterSubscriberDE
```

Just as with column names, if the name of your Data Extension has spaces in it, be sure to enclose it in brackets.

```sql {4}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
FROM [Master Subscriber DE]
```

There are, however, two cases, specific to Salesforce Marketing Cloud, that adds a twist. System Data Views and Enterprise Data Extensions.

### System Data Views

[System Data Views](sfmc-sql-system-data-views.mdx) are partially hidden Data Extensions used by the Salesforce Marketing Cloud to store data. Thing about Email Sent history, Opens and Clicks, Bounces and Complaints. You can find there also tracking data for SMS and Social channels. Also more technical data points, like Jobs and Enterprise Attributes, are using System Data Views. The difference related to those tables is in naming convention. When querying them you must leverage `_` prefix:

```sql {8}
SELECT
    JobID,
    EmailID,
    EmailName,
    EmailSubject,
    EmailSendDefinition,
    DeliveredTime
FROM _Job
```

### Enterprise Data Extension

If you want to query Shared Data Extensions or Synchronized Data Extensions you must use different special prefix, `ENT.`:

```sql {4}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
FROM ENT.SharedSegment
```

Remember that account permissons restrictions may apply.

:::note You Should Know

In some scenarios you might want to use both above options in the same time. For example, if you query System Data View _Subscribers on child Business Unit, you will receive data only for the subscribers stored in this child. In case you want to query all your subscribers, you should point to Enterprise level System Data View:

```sql {6}
SELECT
    SubscriberKey,
    EmailAddress,
    DateJoined,
    DateUnsubscribed
FROM ENT._Subscribers
```

:::

When selecting Data Extensions to pull data from, remember about a best practice to avoid ones spanning a cumulative field width greater than 4000 characters. They will badly impact performance of your query. If needed, consider splitting your query into multiple consecutive queries.

## Join on

## Where

### Conditions

Also supports `CASE`

## Group by

## Order by

## Union

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/set-operators-union-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15

## Nested statements




1. Avoid non-searchable operators for the WHERE clause (OR, NOT, <, >, NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, NOT LIKE, intrinsic functions). Those operators cannot take advantage of indexes and cause the query activity to run more slowly. More efficient operators (=, AND) improve queries.

```sql
SELECT emailaddress as ‘Email_Address’, [Favorite Colour] as ‘Favorite_Color’
FROM [MasterData Extension] m
INNER JOIN JuneMarketingSend j
ON m.emailaddress = j.emailaddress
WHERE m.emailaddress is not NULL
```

Running this query retrieves email and favorite color from the master data extension, and joins it with any matching email addresses from the June marketing send. Additionally, it only returns emails that are not missing. Also notice the m and the j. These are SQL aliases that are used to give a table, or a field in a table, a temporary name. This is especially helpful when you have a common field name between data extensions, like CustomerID or EmailAddress. You can also see it written like the following.

SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID

Example for exclusive offer to customers who have opened an email in the last 6 months and have made a purchase during that time.

SELECT c.EmailAddress, c.CustomerID, c.First_Name
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Purchases p
ON c.CustomerID = p.CustomerID
WHERE [Purchase Date] > DateAdd(month, -6, GetDate()) AND [Open Date] > DateAdd(month, -6, GetDate())


Common Queries
Parent Accounts
You can query data extensions in the Shared Data Extension folder from the parent account by adding the prefix ent. to the data extension name in the query. 
SELECT EmailAddress
FROM ent.MasterDataExtension
