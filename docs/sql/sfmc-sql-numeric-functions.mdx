Saleforce Marketing Cloud SQL implementation does not support user-defined functions. There are, however, multiple built-in functions that are really useful on day-to-day basis when working with queries.

Here, I will cover only selected numeric functions, that I find most useful for Marketing Automation purposes. They will help you do basic calculations or format the numbers to match your needs.

### FORMAT with Numbers

The `FORMAT` works only with datetime and numeric values and requires:

1. Value to be formatted (can be column, string or function)
2. Format specifier to be applied
3. Optionally - ISO culture code

It is perfect tool to manipulate any numbers (or numeric strings) available in your Data Extensions.
