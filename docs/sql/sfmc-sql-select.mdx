<LeadText content='Selected information on the SELECT statement in SFMC SQL' />

The `SELECT` statement opens each query. It both defines the columns of data extensions and system data views that will be needed, as well as allows you to create entirely new data points.

The simplest version of this statement is `SELECT *`, which targets all available columns from the source. I do not recommend this approach, as it is terrible for both readability and performance of your query. It is why [Query Studio](sfmc-sql-basics#query-studio) does not support this shortcut.

The prefered method is targeting columns explicitly by their names:

```sql
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddres
```

If a column name contains a space, you need to capture it with squared brackets:

```sql {4}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddres,
    [External Contact Id]
```

There are also some exceptional cases related to selected [System Data Views](sfmc-sql-system-data-views) in Salesforce Marketing Cloud, where you need to use an underscore prefix before a name (for example when taking Subscriber ID from Enterprise Attributes):

```sql {2}
SELECT
    _SubscriberId
```

### Labels

You can also utilize `SELECT` as a tool to rename the source columns to match your needs in an outcome data extension. It is especially useful when you are pulling the data from Synchronized Data Extension with names coming from Salesforce custom fields.

```sql {4-5}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender
```

### Custom values

Use labels also for passing new values directly from your query. Need to add a custom string to outcome data extension? Or maybe synchronization timestamp for debugging purposes? You can leverage SQL for it.

```sql {6} title="Add custom column labaled 'ImportDate' with value equal to the UTC time of the script execution for each record"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender,
    'Lead' AS RecordType,
    GETUTCDATE() AS ImportDate
```

:::note You Should Know

You can even go further with creating new values by leveraging existing data! For example, if you have first name and last name, you can use SQL to create a FullName column from scratch:

```sql {4}
SELECT
    SubscriberKey,
    EmailAddress,
    FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName
```

This becomes truly powerful with the [SQL functions](sfmc-sql-functions).

### CASE Conditional values

`CASE` statement evaluates a list of conditions and returns one of the multiple possible result expressions. For Marketing Cloud purposes, it is especially useful when you not only want to select a column but also modify the values within it. Perfect for translating numeric codes to descriptive ones for personalization purposes. Excellent for standardizing data (change those `1`, `true` and `on` values of opt-in to a single format).

```sql {7-14}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender,
    'Lead' AS RecordType,
    GETUTCDATE() AS ImportDate,
    CASE MemberType__c
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
    END
```

You can also leverage [labels](#labels) to manipulate the column name at the same time:

```sql {14}
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender,
    'Lead' AS RecordType,
    GETUTCDATE() AS ImportDate,
    CASE MemberType__c
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
    END AS MemberType
```

Above examples are already useful in segmentation, but there is also one more way to write and use `CASE` statement that gives even more power. The search `CASE`.

The difference is that you are not passing the column name on which you will be building conditions. Instead, you create a boolean expression from scratch for each scenario.

```sql {7-14} title="The same Query as the previous one, but written with Search Case"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    EmailAddress,
    [External Contact Id] AS ExternalContactId,
    Gender__c AS Gender,
    'Lead' AS RecordType,
    GETUTCDATE() AS ImportDate,
    CASE
        WHEN MemberType__c = 1 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 2 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 3 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN MemberType__c = 4 THEN 'Platinum'
        ELSE 'Unregistered'
    END AS MemberType
```

The example above doesn't show why it is worth to use the search `CASE`. It is a bit longer than the standard approach! But there is a reason to use this form of `CASE` statement that is visible once you want to create more elaborate conditions that are possible only with this version:

```sql {3-7} title="Lets calculate what channel we should use in our campaign for a given user"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    CASE
        WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1 THEN 'Push'
        WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL THEN 'Email'
        WHEN PhoneOptIn = 1 AND Mobile IS NOT NULL THEN 'Phone'
    END AS PrefferedChannel
```

As you can see, thanks to search `CASE` statement we were able to check conditions on multiple different columns and connect them with `AND`/`OR` statements for better control. You can use this version of the `CASE` statement for all your needs (even those covered by the basic one) to worry not about two ways of formatting.

:::note You Should Know
You can use `CASE` statements inside a `CASE` statement to have an even more dynamic query.

```sql {3-16} title="Let's add another dimension of membership level to differentiate available channels"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    CASE
        WHEN MemberType = 'Platinum' THEN 'Key Account Manager'
        WHEN MemberType = 'Gold' OR MemberType = 'Silver' THEN
            CASE
                WHEN PhoneOptIn = 1 AND Mobile IS NOT NULL THEN 'Phone'
                WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL THEN 'Email'
                WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1 THEN 'Push'
            END
        WHEN MemberType = 'Bronze' THEN
            CASE
                WHEN EmailOptIn = 1 AND EmailAddress IS NOT NULL THEN 'Email'
                WHEN IsAppInstalled = 1 THEN 'Push'
            END
    END AS PrefferedChannel
```

#### LIKE in CASE

`LIKE` is not only useful in the [`WHERE` Statement](sfmc-sql-where#like-operator). Is is also awesome tool empowering `CASE` statement. It allows you to build flexible conditions on freetext values:

```sql {4} title="Great way to split your database between Internal and External users for different communication"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    CASE
        WHEN EmailAddress LIKE '%@mateuszdabrowski.pl' THEN 'Internal'
        ELSE 'External'
    END AS ContactType
```

To use basic `LIKE`, you need to leverage at least one of the two available wildcards:

Wildcard | Description
-- | --
`%` | Zero, one or more characters
`_` | Exactly one character

For example, you can search for `%@mateuszdabrowski.pl` in `EmailAddress` to get all contacts with an email address ending with `@mateuszdabrowski.pl`. However, you can change this filter to `%@mateuszdabrowski%`. With the second wildcard at the end, it will be looking for any email address that contains `@mateuszdabrowski` but may have more text on either side of it. It will capture `@mateuszdabrowski.pl` domain just as the previous filter, but also return `@mateuszdabrowski.com`, `@mateuszdabrowski.sfmc.eu` and other such domains.

There are also more advanced `LIKE` features allowing you to create even more complex conditions:

Advanced Wildcard | Description
-- | --
`[]` | Any single character from the list specified inside
`-` | Range operator for `[]`
`^` | Exclusion operator for `[]`

:::note You Should Know

Group wildcard (`[]`) is also useful as a way to escape character in the `LIKE` statement. For example, you might want to look for all values including a percent sign (`%`).

Writing `LIKE '10%'` is not good idea, as it would return to you all values starting with `10` - as the percent sign is a wildcard meaning zero, one or more characters. You can, however, obtain exactly what you want by writing:

```sql {4-5} title="If the client has discount between 1 and 9%, let's bump it up to either 5% or 10%. If he or she has higher - leave it as it is. If no discount is available, make it 2%"
SELECT
    ContactKey,
    CASE
        WHEN Discount LIKE '[5-9][%]' THEN '10%'
        WHEN Discount LIKE '[1-4][%]' THEN '5%'
        WHEN Discount IS NOT NULL THEN Discount
        ELSE '2%'
    END AS NewDiscount
```

By wrapping the percent sign with the grouping sign `[]` we are telling SQL to look for exactly the percent sign. Thanks to it `'[1-4][%]'` search will look for `1%`, `2%`, `3%` or `4%` values only.

### Table Prefixes

Additional elements that you will be using in many of your queries are table prefixes for selecting columns from multiple joined Data Extensions.

```sql {2-3}
SELECT
    _Subscriber.SubscriberKey
    _EnterpriseAttribute.LastName
```

I'm covering this topic in-depth in [`JOIN` statement documentation](sfmc-sql-join#table-name-prefix).

### Flow control

Despite official [SFMC SQL documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_as_sql_reference.htm&type=5) states that it supports the `IF` constructs, I was not able to make it work.

### Variables & Functions

Unfortunately, SFMC SQL does not support variables.

Fortunately, it does support (selected) functions. Learn more about them in [SFMC SQL Functions documentation](sfmc-sql-functions).
