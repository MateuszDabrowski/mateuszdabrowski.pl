## Problem

Deliverability issues, unfortunately, are a standard both during the Salesforce Marketing Cloud implementation phase, as well as after the go-live.

The test you sent to yourself during the Marketing Cloud implementation that never arrived at the inbox. The subscriber that asks where is his newsletter with the promo code.

You can try to debug it with Journey Builder data or Reports, but in most cases, those solutions provide either not enough or way too much for the specific check you need to make.

## Solution

My favourite way to debug email sends is by using a SQL Query. Open your [Query Studio](./sfmc-sql-basics.mdx#query-studio) and copy-paste the below code:

```sql
SELECT
    s.SubscriberKey,
    sub.EmailAddress,
    sub.Status,
    j.JourneyName,
    j.VersionNumber AS JourneyVersion,
    job.EmailName,
    s.EventDate AS SentDate,
    job.DeliveredTime AS DeliveryDate,
    o.EventDate AS OpenDate,
    c.EventDate AS ClickDate,
    b.EventDate AS BounceDate,
    b.BounceCategory,
    b.BounceSubcategory,
    b.SMTPBounceReason AS BounceReason,
    u.EventDate AS UnsubscribeDate
FROM _Sent s
LEFT JOIN _Job job ON s.JobID = job.JobID
LEFT JOIN _Open o ON s.JobID = o.JobID
    AND s.ListID = o.ListID
    AND s.BatchID = o.BatchID
    AND s.SubscriberID = o.SubscriberID
    AND o.IsUnique = 1
LEFT JOIN _Click c ON s.JobID = c.JobID
    AND s.ListID = c.ListID
    AND s.BatchID = c.BatchID
    AND s.SubscriberID = c.SubscriberID
    AND c.IsUnique = 1
LEFT JOIN _Bounce b ON s.JobID = b.JobID
    AND s.ListID = b.ListID
    AND s.BatchID = b.BatchID
    AND s.SubscriberID = b.SubscriberID
    AND b.IsUnique = 1
LEFT JOIN _Unsubscribe u ON s.JobID = u.JobID
    AND s.ListID = u.ListID
    AND s.BatchID = u.BatchID
    AND s.SubscriberID = u.SubscriberID
    AND u.IsUnique = 1
LEFT JOIN _JourneyActivity ja ON s.TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID = ja.JourneyActivityObjectID
LEFT JOIN _Journey j ON ja.VersionID = j.VersionID
LEFT JOIN _Subscribers sub ON s.SubscriberKey = sub.SubscriberKey
WHERE CONVERT(DATE, s.EventDate) >= DATEADD(DAY, -1, CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE()))
```

Within a few seconds you will see information about sends from the last day. With all the details that might be useful for debugging, like STMP Bounce Reason, Subscriber Status, Unsubscribe Date, etc.

:::note You Should Know

If you are running it from child Business Unit and do not see EmailAddress, BounceCount and Status, add `ENT.` prefix to `_Subscribers` Data View name in the last `JOIN`. It will pull the data from _Subscribers of parent Business Unit.

## Options

You can even adapt the above query to better suit your needs.

### Change timeframe

My default is checking the sends from last day. You can change it by modifying the [`DATEADD` function](./sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#dateadd).

### Limit to single subscriber

If you are looking for a problem related to only one specific subscriber you can add `s.SubscriberKey = 'SubscriberKeyOfThatContact'` or `sub.EmailAddress = 'specific@email.address'` to the [`WHERE` statement](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#logical-operators). Or replace the current one not to be limited by the timeframe.

### Limit to single domain

If you see problems with deliverability for a particular user, I highly recommend checking whether any other users from the same domain are also having such issues. Maybe it is related to corporate server policy? Add `sub.Domain = 'Recipients.Domain'` to the [`WHERE` statement](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#logical-operators). Or replace the current one not to be limited by the timeframe.

### Limit to single email

If the problem is related to just one particular Email asset, you can limit your outcomes by adding `job.EmailName = 'ProblematicEmailName'` to the [`WHERE` statement](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#logical-operators). Or replace the current one not to be limited by the timeframe.

### Limit to single journey

If you want to focus on a single Journey, you can limit your outcomes by adding `j.JourneyName = 'ProblematicJourneyName'` to the [`WHERE` statement](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#logical-operators). Or replace the current one not to be limited by the timeframe. You can also pinpoint it even further by filtering on `j.JourneyVersion`.

### Limit to single engagement type

If you are interested only in bounces and do not need any other sends, add `b.IsUnique = 1` to the [`WHERE` statement](./sfmc-sql-where.mdx#logical-operators).

You can use the same approach to output only opens or clicks by changing the prefix from `b` to the [alias](./sfmc-sql-join.mdx#table-name-prefix) representing the needed [System Data View](../config/sfmc-config-system-data-views.mdx).
