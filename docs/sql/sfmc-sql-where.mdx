## Nested statements




1. Avoid non-searchable operators for the WHERE clause (OR, NOT, <, >, NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, NOT LIKE, intrinsic functions). Those operators cannot take advantage of indexes and cause the query activity to run more slowly. More efficient operators (=, AND) improve queries.

```sql
SELECT emailaddress as ‘Email_Address’, [Favorite Colour] as ‘Favorite_Color’
FROM [MasterData Extension] m
INNER JOIN JuneMarketingSend j
ON m.emailaddress = j.emailaddress
WHERE m.emailaddress is not NULL
```

Running this query retrieves email and favorite color from the master data extension, and joins it with any matching email addresses from the June marketing send. Additionally, it only returns emails that are not missing. Also notice the m and the j. These are SQL aliases that are used to give a table, or a field in a table, a temporary name. This is especially helpful when you have a common field name between data extensions, like CustomerID or EmailAddress. You can also see it written like the following.

SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID

Example for exclusive offer to customers who have opened an email in the last 6 months and have made a purchase during that time.

SELECT c.EmailAddress, c.CustomerID, c.First_Name
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Purchases p
ON c.CustomerID = p.CustomerID
WHERE [Purchase Date] > DateAdd(month, -6, GetDate()) AND [Open Date] > DateAdd(month, -6, GetDate())


Common Queries
Parent Accounts
You can query data extensions in the Shared Data Extension folder from the parent account by adding the prefix ent. to the data extension name in the query. 
SELECT EmailAddress
FROM ent.MasterDataExtension
