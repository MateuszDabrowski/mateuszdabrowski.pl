## What is Open Time Email Campaign

The general rule of email communication is that the momement you send the email you loose control over it (just like with paper mail). There are, however, two exceptions:

1. __Links__ - you cannot change the URL used in the email, but - if you use wrapper/tracking links - you can change the final target URL. In Marketing Cloud this feature is called [updating Job Links](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_es_update_joblinks_overview.htm).
2. __Images__ - you cannot change the URL of the image used in the email, but you can change the image hosted behind that URL. This is exactly what Open Time Email feature in Interaction Studio is all about.
