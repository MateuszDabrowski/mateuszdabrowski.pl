## Catalog Basics & Limitations

The purpose of the Interaction Studio Catalog is to store your data along with relationships for the personalisation and machine learning purposes.

There are five out-of-the-box objects: Products, Articles, Blog Posts, Categories and Promotions. You can also create **up to 25 custom** Catalog Objects.

Each of those Objects contain some built-in attributes (like Name, URL, Description, Promotable) and can be extended with custom attributes to a **total of 35 attributes** on an Object.

All of the above can be interconnected using prebuilt and custom relationships between Catalog Objects (for example, built-in relationship between Product and a Category) - with **up to 15 Categories per Item** and **up to 50 related Catalog Object values per Item**.

With **up to 2 000 000 Items per Catalog** and **up to 10 000 000 Items in total** across all Catalogs, Interaction Studio provides a lot of flexibility to architect a Catalog of your dreams.

However, there are some quirks and features requiring a bit more consideration to make the most out of Marketing Cloud Personalization capabilities. Especially as some bad moves can be really hard to reverse. Let's dive in.

## Catalog Data Sources

There are three key sources of data for the Catalog:

1. **Manual via UI** - great for checking data and performing small fixes, but awful for data ingestion.
2. **Web/Mobile SDK** - leverages Sitemap and is real-time, but performance-heavy and dependent on user behaviour.
3. **ETL Feed** - best performance and can cover whole catalog, but fastest possible cadence is every 15 minutes.

So which one should you use - Sitemap or ETL?

### Why not both?

Mixing both sources is very tempting as it sounds like a best of both worlds. Unfortunately, it is not recommended approach due to Interaction Studio backend limitations. Sending the same Items through both channels not only impacts performance, but it can lead to incorrect and not-so-easy to fix issues with your Catalog.

For example, if you control Exclusion and Eligibility of the Products from Sitemap using `promotable` attribute, the ETL is not able to overwrite it (despite officially having higher priority as a data source). This can quickly lead to huge discrepancies in Product availability for recommendations. Due to the that, I highly recommend enabling Strict Catalog Security setting to protect your Catalog integrity if you are using ETL.

Another issue related to mixing are functional differences between the sources. For example, Sitemap and Category ETL use [different mechanism for building hierarchy](https://issues.salesforce.com/issue/a028c00000gAwJyAAK/interaction-studio-not-correctly-displaying-category-hierarchy) that is not compatible with each other.

To sum up - do not mix Sitemap and ETL. And if you have to - do not mix Sitemap and ETL on the same Object. And if you have to - do not mix Sitemap and ETL for the promotable and archived attributes. But really, do not mix it.

### Sitemap vs ETL

Assuming you want to keep things clean, you are left with two options:

#### 1. Interaction Studio with Sitemap

Pros:
- You need Sitemap either way.
- The updates will happen in near-real-time once user views the Item.
- You can build a [drill-down Category hierarchy](https://issues.salesforce.com/issue/a028c00000gAwJyAAK/interaction-studio-not-correctly-displaying-category-hierarchy) in the UI.

Cons:
- Sitemap will be more complex - depending on how the Catalog detail are stored (dataLayer, JSON LD, HTML) it might get very convoluted and impact the performance of your data capture and Campaigns.
- Changes to the website can break your data capture (for example updates to breadcrump attributes or to how dataLayer is structured).
- Catalog gets updated only when a user views an Item, which creates a risk of incorrect recommendations for less-visited Items.
- Can trigger massive ammounts of concurrent updates for high-traffic Items.
- Cannot overwrite Multi-String Object attributes and relationships (like Category) - Sitemap can only append.
- Catalog can be manipulated from frontend by malicious actors.

#### 2. Interaction Studio with ETL

Pros:
- Full Catalog upsert possible every 15 minutes (delta files recommended).
- Full control over final Catalog values - regardless of Item page vistis.
- Better control over [history of value changes](./snippets/is-catalog-etl-metadata-viewer.mdx) and easier debugging.
- Much better performance, especially for bigger Catalogs.
- More secure with Strict Catalog Security option <br/> **WARNING**: There is currently a bug stopping Add To Cart and Purchase actions from being associated to Categories with this setting enabled.
- Much more lean and performant Sitemap.

Cons:
- Require you to export data in a particulary formatted .csv to IS SFTP.
- Not real-time (but every 15 minutes is pretty damn close, come on!).
- Doesn't support [drill-down Category hierarchy](../../../sites/ideas/interaction-studio-ideas#full-is--mcp-category-hierarchy-support-for-etl) in the UI.

### Recommended IS Catalog Data Source

Considering the above, ETL seems like an obvious choice. And it nearly is. I see only two scenarios where the Sitemap might be chosen to populate the Catalog (spoiler alert, I believe you should try to overcome those scenarios as much as you can).

1. You need to have Item (especially Product) updates in near-real-time.

For example due to very fast changes in the price based on demand. Or due to having single-stock items that needs to be quickly pulled from the recommendations (unfortunately, Purchase action does not adjust the stock). I would consider this only if it is absolutely crucial for your business. Otherwise, the 15 minutes cadence available with ETL is really close and lets you benefit from all the good things.

2. You cannot schedule correctly prepared .csv file to Interaction Studio SFTP.

In most cases your systems already are using flat files and FTPs for communication and you can extend the architecture to cover Interaction Studio. If not - there are a lot of tools out there that can help you transform your data cleanly into nice .csv and add it to Marketing Cloud Personalization Feed with correct naming convention. Hey, you can even leverage Marketing Cloud's Automation Studio to prepare and deliver the file in the right format! But sometimes data is just not there - and then ETL is a no go.

While you can begin with Sitemap and then migrate to ETL approach, the transitory period might be a bit problematic due to issues described in the [Why not both?](#why-not-both) section above. I would recommend trying to find a workaround and starting already with the better option.

Once you know how you want to populate the Interaction Studio Catalog, it's time to decide what you will be filling in.

## Catalog Attributes

Each Catalog provides a set of attributes available on each Item. You can store there metadata about Products, Categories or other Objects - and you can leverage it for recommendations and personalisations. However, there are some quirks and features that needs to be taken into consideration when planning the Catalog Architecture.

### Built-in Catalog Attributes

Let's start with what is available out-of-the-box. There are three groups of available attributes (basic, location-based and promotion-related) plus few special attributes unique to Product and Category Catalogs.

#### Basic Catalog Attributes

Attribute | Data Type | Purpose | Comment
-- | -- | -- | --
ID | String |  Unique identifier for each Item | It must be unique per Object, can be reused in others (for example, you can use the same ID in Product and Category obejcts).
Name  | String | Readable name of an Item | Used to identify an Item across the UI. Does not have to be unique, so you might have multiple Items with the same name. Required to recommend an Item.
URL | String | Link to the Item | Redirect target when User clicks on an Item in a Campaign. Required to recommend an Item.
Image URL | String | Link used to display an Image of an Item | Used to showcase a Product. Required to recommend the Product (not needed for other Item types).
Description | String | Client-friendly description of an Item | Any text beyond 200 characters will be replaced with an ellipsis (`...`).
Average Rating | Decimal | Average score of an Item based on all Ratings | Useful as a filter for Einstein Recipes and Triggered Campaigns.
Number of Ratings | Integer | Number of ratings an Item gathered

Out of the Basic Catalog Attributes the first four are key - ID, Name, URL, Image URL. Average rating is useful for filtering products for Campaigns. The rest might be useful for some personalization purposes, but in most implementations can be skipped.

#### Location Catalog Attributes

Attribute | Data Type
-- | --
City | String
State / Provine Code | String
Postal Code | String
Longitude | Decimal
Latitude | Decimal
Country Code | String

Location-based Attributes are niche but powerful. They are completly useless for most implementations (as in most cases the Item is either available in many locations or its location is irrelevant). However, for businesses that are offering unique, location-based Items (hotels, houses, unique Products), filling in those enables you to leverage location-based recommendations (triggered by either User or currently viewed Item data).

#### Promotion Settings Catalog Attributes

Attribute | Data Type | Purpose | Comment
-- | -- | -- | --
Published | Datetime | Availability start date for an Item | Must be `null` or in the past for Interaction Studio to recommend the Item. If you set it with the future date - Item will not be promoted until then.
Expiration | Datetime | Availability end date for an Item | must be `null` or in the future for Interaction Studio to recommend the Item. Once you hit that date, Item stops being recommended.
Promotable | Picklist | Marks whether Item should be Promoted | Items can be either Eligible or Excluded. Only Eligible ones will be returned in the recommendations, regardless of Published/Expirtation values.
Archived | Boolean | Marks whether Item should be Archived | Archived Items are treated as Excluded (are not returned in the recommendations) and are hidden from the Catalog UI.

:::note You Should Know

Published and Expiration fields are ISO-8601 datetime fields meaning they must be passed formatted as `2022-04-12T10:23:37Z`.

If you want to push a datetime to Interaction Studio using [ETL](#2-interaction-studio-with-etl), you can prepare the data with SQL using clean [FORMAT](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#format-with-dates): `FORMAT(YourDateField,'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ')` and output it to a String field type (Text, if we are talking SFMC Data Extension).

:::

Promotion-related attributes are crucial for controlling what is being recommended. They are also the most tricky ones, as they seem to be very simillar to each other. Rule of thumb when selecting what to use:

1. If you are frequently updating the Catalog (thansk to using [ETL](#2-interaction-studio-with-etl)), go with Promotable attribute.
2. If you have less control over when the update will come (due to using [Sitemap](#1-interaction-studio-with-sitemap)), or need the recommendation to start/end at a very specific time that is not perfectly aligned with your sync schedule, go with Published/Expiration attributes.
3. If you are absolutely sure you don't need an Item, archive it. But I would treat it as a solution of last resort for some incorrect data, not as a general tool for managing Catalog content.

:::note You Should Know

Archiving does not delete Items (there is no such option in Interaction Studio). It only hides them from the Catalog UI while preserving all its values. This has two important ramifications:

1. Archived Items are still being used by Interaction Studio personalisation engine - especially, they are still being used as anchors for recommendations. For example, if you have a campaign promoting Similar Items to the Item currently viewed, it will work (and leverage all the metadata of an archived Item). If you don't want it to happen, be sure to clean all attributes and relationships before archiving.
2. You won't be able to easily find archived items to make any changes or unarchive them. You can find partial workarounds in the [Tips & Tricks section](#TODO).

#### Product Catalog Unique Attributes

Attribute | Data Type | Purpose | Comment
-- | -- | -- | --
Units in Stock | Integer | Provides products Inventory Count | If product is available but exact stock in unknown, provide 1, otherwise it will not get recommended.
Alternate ID | Multistring | Pipe-separated SKUs for the Product | As there is no option to provide separate details for each SKU, it's quite useless now.
Price | Decimal | Current price of the product | Used for personalization and Einstein Recipe price-based filtering. Price equal to 0 will block product from recommendations.
List Price | Decimal | Full sticker price of the product | Useful for price drop personalization and Product Price Reduction Triggered Campaigns. Unfortunatelly, there is no Price Reduction Recipe [yet](../../../sites/ideas/interaction-studio-ideas#price-reduction-ingredient-in-einstein-recipes).
Price Description | String | Information about the current Price | You can pass here promotion name that resulted in lower Price for personalization purposes.
Currency | String | ISO-4217 Currency Code | Required when you switch on Product Localization and need to capture Product price in multiple currencies. To pass Currency you need to pass it along with Locale.
Margin | Decimal | Profit margin on the Product | Useless.

As you can see, there are two must-have attributes - Units in Stock and Price - followed by one highly recommended for most implementations - List Price. The rest is either niche or useless.

:::note You Should Know

Price attribute should reflect current global price. Site-wide promotions should be applied to it. Client-specific or voucher-based ones - should not. This is because one Product can have only one Price.

Don't worry about final, unique price in the basket. Cart and Purchase actions have a separate model for storing the Cart Item price that can be different for each Client and won't impact the global Product Catalog Price.

ID Path | Multistring
Is Department | Boolean
