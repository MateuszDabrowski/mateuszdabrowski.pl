## Catalog Basics & Limitations

The purpose of the Interaction Studio Catalog is to store your data along with relationships for the personalisation and machine learning purposes.

There are five out-of-the-box objects: Products, Articles, Blog Posts, Categories and Promotions. You can also create up to 25 custom Catalog Objects.

Each of those Objects contain some built-in attributes (like Name, URL, Description, Promotable) and can be extended with custom attributes to a total of 35 attributes on an Object.

All of the above can be interconnected using prebuilt and custom relationships between Objects (for example, built-in relationship between Product and a Category).
