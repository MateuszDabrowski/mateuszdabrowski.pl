<LeadText content="Build the dream campaign configuration UI for your marketers in Marketing Cloud Personalization (Interaction Studio). All the input magic in one place." />

Once you learn the [very basics of Serverside Code](./mcp-serverside-code-basics.mdx) in Marketing Cloud Personalization (Interaction Studio) it is time to start writing code. The easiest way is to begin with creating the campaign creation UI for the marketer - defining all the inputs they will need to fill in to drive the experience. It will be our focus in this article.

MCP Serverside Code offers five basic property data types: [Boolean](#boolean), [String](#string), [Number](#number), [Color](#color) and [DateTime](#datime). Those, their combinations into [complex properties](#complex-property) and modifications through [decorators](#decorators) enable you to build nearly anything you need for your campaign configuration screen.

Let's dive into how you can make the most of those features.

## Basic properties

Basic properties are the base building blocks of your campaign configuration. You can make a perfect campaign template with only them and mastering them will be key to do more complex UI's with [complex properties](#complex-property) and [decorators](#decorators).

### Boolean

Boolean property lets you capture a `true` or `false` flag by creating a checkbox input:

```ts title="Create simple checkbox"
isTextLeftToRight: boolean;
// Input: Editable unchecked checkbox
// Output: true or false
```

The boolean property is unchecked by default (returns `false`), but you can change it by passing a `true` value in the code:

```ts title="Checkbox checked by default"
isTextLeftToRight: boolean = true;
// Input: Editable checked checkbox
// Output: true or false
```

Boolean fields are crucial for the template development as they are perfect for building logic, for example with the [`@shownIf` decorator](#hidden--shownif).

### String

String property lets you capture a text input:

```ts title="Create empty text input field"
content: string;
// Input: Empty text input
// Output: "Provided text"
```

However, there is much more to string property than just that.

#### › Array String

Sometimes you may want to capture more than one string. Easy, you can do it with two characters:

```ts title="Capture multiple strings"
hashtags: string[];
// Input: Empty text input with option for converting entered text into one of the values
// Output: ["Array", "of", "Strings"]
```

By adding `[]` after the type definition we convert the field to an array of strings. During configuration you will be able to provide multiple values that in payload will be returned as an array. It doesn't accept duplicate values.

#### › Default String

To simplify the work for your marketers or provide recommended example of expected data you can easily add a default value to your string by providing it as a string after equal sign:

```ts title="Add default content"
content: string = 'This is default content';
// Input: Editable prefilled text input
// Output: "Provided text"
```

It can be freely edited during configuration, but will be passed as-is to the payload if no changes are made.

:::note You Should Know

You can provide default values also for string arrays:

```ts title="Default values for array string"
hashtags: string[] = ['interaction-studio', 'marketing-cloud-personalization'];
// Input: Editable prefilled text input with two deletable values and space to write additional ones
// Output: ["Array", "of", "Strings"]
```

:::

#### › Select String

You can go one step further and lock the string property to only a set of preconfigured values using `@options` decorator. This is great option when you need a very specific value, for example for a programmatic logic in other part of your template.

```ts title="Limit possible values with select"
@options(['brandA', 'brandB', 'brandC'])
brand: string;
// Input: Empty text input showing dropdown with configured options on click
// Output: "Selected text"
```

With such code the campaign configuration will display a picklist with the hardcoded values. It will output a string to the campaign payload.

You can also provide [default value](#-default-string) for your select field:

```ts title="Provide default select value"
@options(['brandA', 'brandB', 'brandC'])
brand: string = 'brandA';
// Input: Editable prefilled text input showing dropdown with configured options on click
// Output: "Selected text"
```

:::note You Should Know

You can also create select field without the decorator using literals:

```ts title="Literal select field"
brand: 'brandA' | 'brandB' | 'brandC';
// Input: Empty text input showing dropdown with configured options on click
// Output: "Selected text"
```

:::

Just as you can capture array of text inputs, you can also do the same for select strings and create a multi-picklist. However, while the preconfigured options will be visible and easy to pick, new options - outside of what you hardcoded - can be freely added.

```ts title="Multi-picklist"
@options(['brandA', 'brandB', 'brandC'])
brands: string[];
// Input: Empty text field with picklist and option to create new values. Allows for multiple additions.
// Output: ["Array", "of", "Strings"]
```

You can also provide [default value](#-default-string) for your multi-select field:

```ts title="Provide default multi-select values"
@options(['brandA', 'brandB', 'brandC'])
brands: string[] = ['brandA', 'brandB'];
// Input: Editable prefilled text field with picklist and option to create new values. Allows for multiple additions.
// Output: ["Array", "of", "Strings"]
```

It will output array of strings to the campaign payload.

:::note You Should Know

You can also create multi-select field without the decorator using literals:

```ts title="Literal multi-select field"
brand: ('brandA' | 'brandB' | 'brandC')[];
// Input: Empty text field with picklist and option to create new values. Allows for multiple additions.
// Output: ["Array", "of", "Strings"]
```

:::

#### › Rich Text String

You can easily convert this simple text input into a rich text field by using a `@richText` decorator:

```ts title="Capture styling with a single decorator"
@richText(true)
content: string;
// Input: Text input that adapts to the content size and provides bold, italic, underscore and link WYSIWYG options.
// Output: "String with <span style='font-weight:bold;'>optional</span>HTML<br/>Includes multiline"
```

This decorator will change the input field to a multiline box with bold, italic, underscore and link features. The payload will return those styles in a form of HTML that can then be used directly for example in Handlebars tab of Web Campaign.

:::note You Should Know

While the rich text options are very limited, you can write some other HTML (for example `<span>` with style attribute) directly in the box and it will also be passed to the output correctly. It will even display as a formatted text after you revisit the configuration.

:::

### Number

Number property lets you capture integer (`3`) and decimal (`3.14`) values:

```ts title="Create empty numeric input"
recommendationsCount: number;
// Input: Empty text (sic!) input
// Output: 3.14
```

Keep in mind that non-numeric values might break the campaign without any error visible in the configuration screen. You can either display a warning using [`@shownIf` decorator](#hidden--shownif) and a [string field](#string) or create sanitization logic in the run block.

:::note You Should Know

You can use `@unit` [decorator](#decorators) to provide a unit description next to the input. It has no impact on the outputted value, but gives marketer information about the expected value:

```ts {1} title="Unit decorator on number"
@unit('ms')
delayBeforeDisplay: number;
```

:::

#### › Array Number

Just as with strings, you can capture multiple numeric values by adding `[]`:

```ts title="Capture multiple numbers"
productIds: number[];
// Input: A plus icon that adds new text inputs with delete buttons
// Output: [3.14, 3, 5]
```

It will output array of numbers to the campaign payload.

#### › Default Number

Again, just as with strings, you can capture editable default value for your number:

```ts title="Default numeric value"
recommendationsCount: number = 6;
// Input: Editable prefilled text input
// Output: 6
```

And the same can be done for Array Numbers:

```ts title="Default numeric array value"
productIds: number[] = [123, 456, 789];
// Input: Editable and deletable prefilled text inputs and a plus icon that can add more
// Output: [123, 456, 32]

```

#### › Select Number

As with [strings](#-select-string), you can create a numeric picklist:

```ts title="Numeric picklist"
recommendationsCount: 1 | 3 | 6 | 9;
// Input: Empty text input showing dropdown with configured options on click
// Output: 1
```

You can also pass a default value:
```ts title="Numeric picklist"
recommendationsCount: 1 | 3 | 6 | 9 = 6;
// Input: Editable prefilled text input showing dropdown with configured options on click
// Output: 6
```

You can also create a numeric multipicklist:

```ts title="Numeric multi-picklist"
orderOfSections: (1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5)[];
// Input: Empty text field with picklist. Allows for multiple additions.
// Output: [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]
```

Different from [strings multi-select](#-select-string), with numeric multi-picklist marketer won't be able to add new options outside of what you preconfigured. Yay!

However, there are three caveats to keep in mind:

1. You cannot have `0` as one of the options. The picklist will crash.
2. You cannot use `@options` to create the picklist. It will be ignored.
3. The single-select picklist will always cut the visibility of the last digit in the longest option after selecting it.

### Color

Color property let's you create a color picker with a single line of code:

```ts title="Create color picker"
backgroundColor: Color;
// Input: An input pseudo-prefilled with #FFFFFF and color box that on click opens color selection interface
// Output: {
//    "hex": "#da4e55",
//    "r": 218,
//    "g": 78,
//    "b": 85,
//    "a": 1
//}
```

You will be able to select the color by dragging the selector over a colour palette or by providing hex/rgba/hsl values. The property will output to payload a `color` object with both hex and rgba values.

:::note You Should Know

While the property will look like it is prefilled with white color, until you pick a color in the interface, it will output `null`. If you want the white to be working default option, you must configure it explicitly.

:::

#### › Default Color

You can provide a default color, but in this case it will be a bit more complex. You cannot just provide a single hex value, you need to replicate the whole output object:

```ts title"Default color value"
backgroundColor: Color = {
    "hex": "#da4e55",
    "r": 218,
    "g": 78,
    "b": 85,
    "a": 1
};
// Input: An input truly-prefilled with #FFFFFF and color box that on click opens color selection interface
// Output: {
//    "hex": "#da4e55",
//    "r": 218,
//    "g": 78,
//    "b": 85,
//    "a": 1
//}
```

### Datetime

Datetime property provides a clean looking calendar widget that lets marketer easily pick up a date.

```ts title="Create datetime picker"
promotionDate: DateTime;
// Input: Empty input with calendar icon that on click opens full calendar for date selection
// Output: {
//    "dateTime": [
//        "2023-10-01T16:00:00.000Z"
//    ]
//}
```

There are two payload-related things to consider:

1. DateTime property always outputs an object with a single `dateTime` property assigned to an array of strings.
2. The datetimes are returned as ISO 8601 strings (`2023-10-01T16:00:00.000Z`).

#### › Datetime Range

While you cannot create multi-select datetime field, you can use `@range` decorator to be able to select two dates with a nice UI.

```ts title="Create range datetime picker"
@range(true)
promotionDate: DateTime;
// Input: Empty input with calendar icon that on click opens full calendar for two dates selection with range indicator
// Output: {
//    "dateTime": [
//        "2023-10-01T16:00:00.000Z",
//        "2023-10-03T16:00:00.000Z"
//    ]
//}
```

The output will return both selected dates in the `dateTime` array of strings.

---

## Readonly property

Apart from [basic string property](#string) there is also a very similar readonly string property:

```ts title="Static readonly property"
readonly templateVersion = "Version 1.1"
// Input: No input, just a readonly text written in the form
// Output: 'Version 1.1'
```

As you can see, the key difference is the `readonly` prefix before defining the property. It also uses the [default string](#-default-string) approach to assign the value.

However, readonly property has one superpower. You can assign an arrow function to it (as long as it will return a string) and use values from other properties to transform them:

```ts {2,5-13} title="Dynamic readonly property"
header: string = 'DEFault heaDER';
readonly upperCaseHeader = () => this?.header.toUpperCase || '';
// Input: No input, just a readonly text updating real time based on header input
// Output: 'DEFAULT HEADER'
readonly titleCaseHeader = () => {
    return this?.header
            .toLowerCase()
            .split(' ')
            .filter(word => word !== '')
            .map(word => word.replace(word[0], word[0].toUpperCase()))
            .join(' ')
        || '';
}
// Input: No input, just a readonly text updating real time based on header input
// Output: 'Default Header'
```

With dynamic readonly property you can transform string inputs, concatenate multiple inputs into one field or even create a logic based on non-string inputs (as long at the output is a string).

:::note You Should Know

You can do the same things later in the [run() block](./mcp-serverside-code-basics.mdx#2-run-block). It will be even more powerful there, as you will be able to use the context object. However, you will have to add those calculated values manually to [return statement](./mcp-serverside-code-basics.mdx#3-return-statement) to see it in the payload.

For simple use cases, readonly property will be more strightforward and provide a nifty real time preview of the calculated value for the marketer.

:::

## Complex property

The real input configuration fun starts when you combine [basic properties](#basic-properties) into complex ones. The method is strightforward. Outside the main class that implements CampaignTemplateComponent create a new class export that contains all the basic inputs you need:

```ts title="Define complex property"
export class TimeframedColorPicker {
    @range(true)
    timeframe: DateTime;

    color: Color;
}
```

With complex property defined you can leverage it in the main class the same way as you do with basic properties:

```ts title="Use complex property"
timeframedColor: TimeframedColorPicker;
// Input: Set of basic properties - datetime range and color pickers in this case
// Output: {
//    timeframedColor: {
//        timeframe: "dateTime": [
//            "2023-10-01T16:00:00.000Z",
//            "2023-10-03T16:00:00.000Z"
//        ],
//        color: {
//            "hex": "#da4e55",
//            "r": 218,
//            "g": 78,
//            "b": 85,
//            "a": 1
//        }
//    }
//}
```

What are the benefits of this approach?

1. You can define your complex property class once and then use it multiple times in your form.
2. You can control the structure of Serverside payload.

Complex property is creating a new nested object assigned to a input property. Let's look at the difference:

```ts title="Payload using basic properties"
@range(true)
timeframe: Date;

color: Color;
// Input: Two basic properties - datetime range and color pickers in this case
// Output: {
//    timeframe: "dateTime": [
//        "2023-10-01T16:00:00.000Z",
//        "2023-10-03T16:00:00.000Z"
//    ],
//    color: {
//        "hex": "#da4e55",
//        "r": 218,
//        "g": 78,
//        "b": 85,
//        "a": 1
//    }
//}
```

```ts {4,16} title="Payload using complex property"
timeframedColor: TimeframedColorPicker;
// Input: Set of basic properties - datetime range and color pickers in this case
// Output: {
//    timeframedColor: {
//        timeframe: "dateTime": [
//            "2023-10-01T16:00:00.000Z",
//            "2023-10-03T16:00:00.000Z"
//        ],
//        color: {
//            "hex": "#da4e55",
//            "r": 218,
//            "g": 78,
//            "b": 85,
//            "a": 1
//        }
//    }
//}
```

As you can see, complex property is taking the basic output and assigning it to the field using the complex property. This can help with payload readability and might be crucial when you have to adapt your payload to a specific requirements (for example, schema expected by React website or 3rd party system).

3. You can nest complex properties

Just as you can add a complex property to a field, you can also create a complex property using complex properties. While it can again give you all the benefits mentioned here, be careful not to go overboard. Deep nesting is harder to understand and use. There is no perfect rule, but check out [Simple/Complex recommendations in Zen of SFMC](../zen-of-sfmc/#simple-is-better-than-complex).

4. You can leverage it to build an Array of complex properties!

This is the real game changer - out of the basic properties only [Strings](#-array-string) and [Numbers](#-array-string) can be used an arrays. But using a complex one, you can leverage also Boolean, Color and Datetime. The approach is the same as previously - just add `[]`:

```ts {4,16} title="Array of complex properties"
timeframedColor: TimeframedColorPicker[];
// Input: A plus icon that adds new sets of basic properties with delete buttons
// Output: {
//    timeframedColor: [{
//        timeframe: "dateTime": [
//            "2023-10-01T16:00:00.000Z",
//            "2023-10-03T16:00:00.000Z"
//        ],
//        color: {
//            "hex": "#da4e55",
//            "r": 218,
//            "g": 78,
//            "b": 85,
//            "a": 1
//        }
//    }]
//}
```

It allows you to capture multiple complex configurations (for example, multiple recommendations or - as in example above - multiple colors that can change in the campaign based on the current date).

:::note You Should Know

There is a [bug with the removal UI](https://issues.salesforce.com/issue/a028c00000p5gvMAAQ/personalization-incorrect-behaviour-of-array-of-complex-objects-in-templates) for arrays of complex properties.

Lets say you have multiple properties configured in an array and want to remove one. If you click the removal button, regardless for which element you did it, the UI will remove the bottom one. However, in the backend the correct one was removed, which you can check in the Payload Preview. Save, reenter configuration screen or refresh, and you will see the correct configuration.

:::

### Complex default values

With complex properties you can provide default values in two ways:

1. You can provide default values within the defining class directly on basic properties.

```ts title="Define complex property with default values"
export class RecommendationsConfig {
    recommendationsHeader: String = 'Chosen for You';
    recommendationsDisplayed: Number = 6;
}
```

This approach will work for complex property arrays, but not for single complex property.

2. You can provide default value in the main class implementing the CampaignTemplateComponent.

```ts title="Use complex property with default value"
recsConfig: RecommendationsConfig = {
  "recommendationsHeader": "Chosen for You",
  "recommendationsDisplayed": 6
};
```

This approach will work for single complex property and - if you provide the default value(s) in the array - also for arrays for complex properties.

```ts title="Use array of complex properties with default values"
recsConfig: RecommendationsConfig = [{
  "recommendationsHeader": "Chosen for You",
  "recommendationsDisplayed": 6
}, {
  "recommendationsHeader": "Bestsellers",
  "recommendationsDisplayed": 3
}];
```

As you can see both approaches work for arrays of complex properties but they result in a different outcome. The first approach provides a default values to all element of a complex property array that you will create. The second approch pre-fills the array with the provided default elements. You can use both at the same time to have few array elements prefilled and provide default values for all new elements created on top of it.

### Complex picklist


### Complex tabular view

---

## Decorators

Decorators are a TypeScript feature that can change or extend behaviour of properties in the MC Personalization's Serverside Code. You already seen some of them:

- [`@options`](#-select-string) used to provide picklist values for [strings](#-select-string), [numbers](#-select-number) and [complex properties](#complex-picklist).
- [`@richtext`](#-rich-text-string) that changes string input.
- [`@unit`](#number) that gives context to a numeric input.
- [`@range`](#-datetime-range) that modifies date selection into range selection.
- [`@tabular`](#complex-tabular-view) that changes how a complex object is displayed.

But there is so much more available:

### @title & @subtitle

When you add a property, its name will be used as a label for the input - in a smart way, with space being added before each uppercase (but not a digit):

```ts title="Examples of default conversion from property name to label"
header: string;             // Label: Header
productDescription: string; // Label: Product Description
listElement3: string;       // Label: List Element3
```

That's neat, but sometimes you might want to be more descriptive - without changing the actual property passed in the payload. This is where `@title` decorator comes in. By adding it above a property and passing a string you can change the label to anything you want.

```ts {1} title="Examples of default conversion from property name to label"
@title('Recommendations Box Header')
header: string;             // Label: Recommendations Box Header
```

:::note You Should Know

You can also pass a space into `@title` decorator to remove the input label altogether:

```ts {1} title="Using space to hide the label"
@title(' ')
header: string;             // No label
```

It can be useful in some cases. Complex objects that have both their own label as well as labels of all properties used to create them. Or cases where you want to use [`@markdown`](#markdown) decorator instead.

:::

On the other hand, adding `@subtitle` decorator above a property will show the provided text in a smaller font right below the input. Great tool to provide a bit more context or example data to aid the person configuring the campaign.

```ts {2} title="Example use of @subheader decorator for added context"
@title('Recommendations Box Header')
@subheader('Use Title Case and stay below 40 characters')
header: string;
```

### @markdown

When [`@title` and `@subtitle`](#header--headersubtitle) are not enough for the context you want to provide, you can use `@markdown` decorator


### @header & @headerSubtitle

There is also a pair of `@header` and `@subheader` decorators are very similar to [`@title` and `@subtitle`](#title--subtitle) with one key difference - they are not attaching to a property. That's right, you can use them anywhere to add context to a whole sections of your campaign configuration form.

```ts  title="Example use of @subheader decorator for added context"
@header('Recommendations Box Header')
@headerSubtitle('Use Title Case and stay below 40 characters')
```

The `@header` will be in the same font size as input labels and `@headerSubtitle` will match [`@subtitle`](#title--subtitle) style.

Oh, and using passing single space to `@header` will create a bit of padding. Perfect for those of us with OCD that can't stand that uneven spacing between inputs.

### @hidden & @shownIf

### @buttonGroup

### @optional
