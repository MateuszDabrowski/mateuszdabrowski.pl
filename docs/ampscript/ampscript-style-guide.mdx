First things first: this Salesforce Marketing Cloud AMPScript style guide is highly subjective. You may use it as it is, implement only some parts of it, or ignore it altogether. There are only two rules that I believe are a must-have:

1. Be consistent across your codebase.
2. Strive for good readability.

Everything else is preference. And you are just about to learn about mine.

## Naming Convention

AMPScript gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to naming and letter case. But instead of going freestyle with that flexibility, we should leverage it to build something meaningful and readable. I decided to focus also on simplicity.

### Meaningful Names

__Use descriptive names to provide context.__

As [John F. Woods](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.c++/c/rYCO5yn4lXw/m/oITtSkZOtoUJ?pli=1) said, `always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live`. Meaningful and consistent names are an excellent starting point for living a long (coding) life with a limited amount of frustration and regret when someone asks you about your year-old code to adapt to a new project.

Applying the rules listed below is easy when you write the code and remember its logic but can be a challenge after resetting your memory by writing few other scripts. Make your AMPScript better with meaningful variable names:

1. Use descriptive variable names. It is better to have a long explicit one (`IsTrackingSuppressed`) than a short mysterious abbreviation (`Trk`).
2. When the variable is a boolean, prefix it with `Is` (or `Has`/`Does`/`Are` depending on the underlying data).
3. When the variable is a date, suffix it with `Date`.

```js
/* ✅ Descriptive and suggesting boolean data type */
SET @isTrackingSuppressed = false;

/* ❌ Name neither describes the variable purpose nor suggest its data type */
SET @value = false;

/* ✅ Descriptive and suggesting date data type */
SET @trackingSupressionStartDate = Now();

/* ❌ Name neither describes the variable purpose nor suggest its data type */
SET @supressed = Now();
```

### AMPScript Letter Case

AMPScript letter case is a minefield. I have seen all possible combinations of letter case used for variables and AMPScript functions. Both in shared snippets, as well as official documentation.

I even created a [survey](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6807595457716518912/) to check which approach is the most popular. Outcomes from 168 votes?

- 45%: Mix of `ProperCase` and `UPPERCASE` for various elements.
- 30%: `ProperCase` for everything.
- 15%: `UPPERCASE` for everything.
- 10%: Other conventions (including `lowercase` with some `camelCase` for functions and `snake_case` for variables by [Adam Spriggs](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6807595457297084416?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A6807595457297084416%2C6807673667259125762%29&replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A6807595457297084416%2C6807687826575110145%29), co-author of the AMPScript bible - [ampscript.guide](https://ampscript.guide)).

So the best recommendation for you (and your team) to decide on one style - whichever it will be - and stay consistent.

I decided to use mixed approach for the sake of readability. It might not be as simple as focusing on just one letter case format for the whole code, but it improves experience of working with longer and more complex AMPScript a lot.

#### AMPScript Variable Names

__Use `camelCase` for variable names.__

I use `camelCase` for AMPScript variables because:

1. It is more readable than `lowercase` or `UPPERCASE` - especially for longer names.
2. It is easier to differentiate variable name (`@` prefix and `camelCase`) from function name (`PascalCase`), even if they use the same word (frequent for technical variables like counters).
3. It is in line with the [SSJS styling for variables](../ssjs/ssjs-style-guide.mdx#js-variables-functions--methods-letter-case) so it's easier to switch between languages.

```js
VAR @response, @salesforceCampaigns, @rowCount
SET @salesforceCampaigns = RetrieveSalesforceObjects('Campaign', 'Name,Id,StartDate,EndDate', 'IsActive', '=', 'True')
SET @rowCount = RowCount(@salesforceCampaigns)
```

#### AMPScript Functions

__Use `PascalCase` for function names.__

I use `PascalCase` for AMPScript functions because:

1. It is more readable than `lowercase` or `UPPERCASE` - especially for longer names.
2. It is easier to differentiate function name (`PascalCase`) from variable name (`@` prefix and `camelCase`), even if they use the same word (frequent for technical variables like counters).
3. It is in line with the [SSJS styling for built-in functions](../ssjs/ssjs-style-guide.mdx#ssjs-functions-letter-case) so it's easier to switch between languages.

```js
SET @salesforceCampaigns = RetrieveSalesforceObjects('Campaign', 'Name,Id,StartDate,EndDate', 'IsActive', '=', 'True')
SET @rowCount = RowCount(@salesforceCampaigns)
```

#### AMPScript Loops, Ifs and Variable Declarations

__Use `UPPERCASE` for loops, if blocks and variable decalarations.__

Despite I recommend `PascalCase` for most of the AMPScript syntax, I believe that limited usage of `UPPERCASE` can have huge benefit to readability.

I use `UPPERCASE` for three groups of elements:

1. Variable declaration and setting syntax (`VAR` & `SET`).
2. If statement syntax (`IF`, `THEN` `ELSE`, `ENDIF` but also `IIF`).
3. Loop syntax (`FOR`, `TO`/`DOWNTO`, `DO`, `NEXT`).

Those three groups are either key datapoints within your AMPScript code (variables) or the only source of real complexity (if statements and for loops). That's why I recommend to improve readability and increase attention around those parts of the script.

```js
VAR @response, @salesforceCampaigns, @rowCount, @counter, @row, @name, @id, @startDate, @endDate, @rowDate, @response
SET @salesforceCampaigns = RetrieveSalesforceObjects('Campaign', 'Name,Id,StartDate,EndDate', 'IsActive', '=', 'True')
SET @rowCount = RowCount(@salesforceCampaigns)

IF @rowCount > 0 THEN
    FOR @counter = 1 TO @rowCount DO
        SET @row = Row(@retrieve, @counter)
        SET @name = Field(@row, 'Name')
        SET @id = Field(@row, 'Id')
        SET @startDate = Field(@row, 'StartDate')
        SET @endDate = Field(@row, 'EndDate')
        SET @rowDate = Concat(@name, ',', @id, ',', @startDate, ',', @endDate)
        SET @response = Concat(@response, @rowData,';')
    NEXT @counter
ENDIF
