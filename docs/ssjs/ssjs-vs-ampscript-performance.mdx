In Salesforce Marketing Cloud world there is a lot of knowledge shared on blogs, social networks and Stack Exchange. Frequently you will see some strong opinions on which approach is best.

I decided to check some of those assumptions empirically. Some test results are obvious, some might surprise you (just as they surprised me).

The article is split into two sections:

1. [Conclusions](#conclusions) are the TLDR of my tests. If you just want to check which approach might be best for your use case - go there.
2. [Performance Test Cases](#performance-test-cases) are the nerdy part, where I describe the exact code used for each case and more detailed outcomes that might give you better basis for a decision what to use.

:::note You Should Know

This article will be in constant Work In Progress state, as I plan to periodically add new test cases and update conculsions.

Should you have any interesting idea for a test case - let me know!

## Conclusions

Most of the differences are very small - too small to have an impact for most Cloud Page backends, Automation Studio Script Activities or Apps for internal use created within Marketing Cloud. For those use cases I definitely prefer SSJS.

But for scripting in communication assets (Emails, SMS, Pushes, etc) that will be send to huge volumes or previously mentioned use cases where you apply the script to big data extensions, it might have significant impact and help you optimize your Marketing Cloud greatly.




## Methodology

The methodology is very limited by the nature of SSJS and AMPScript. I'm using a Cloud Page and use `new Date().getTime();` to capture beginning and end of the execution. Within this scope, I run a loop with the code I want to test. Finally, I divide the time needed for whole execution by the number of loop iterations to get an average run time.

This approach means that the milisecond values I provide are no way the exact times you can use to calculate the speed at scale. But in the same time should be standardized enough to allow for meaningful comparision between various scenarios. Focus less on exact milisecond count and more on how it is in relation to values for other options.

In the below test case description you can find additional details on the methodology, like input used for test, number of iterations used for loops or exact code that was tested.

## Performance Test Cases

### Proper Case

What should you use, when you want to change a string to Proper Case? As there is no single function in SSJS for that, I compared two pure SSJS approaches (`split`/`join` & `replace` with RegEx) with [AMPScript in SSJS](./ssjs-snippet-ampscript-in-ssjs.mdx) and (nearly) pure AMPScript.

The test was performed using ten different strings varying in number of words and capitalization:
```js
var sentences = [
    'one',                                      // 1
    'one Two',                                  // 2
    'one Two THREE',                            // 3
    'one Two THREE fOUR',                       // 4
    'one Two THREE fOUR FiVe',                  // 5
    'one Two THREE fOUR FiVe siX',              // 6
    'one Two THREE fOUR FiVe siX &',            // 7
    'one Two THREE fOUR FiVe siX & 8',          // 8
    'one Two THREE fOUR FiVe siX & 8 nine',     // 9
    'one Two THREE fOUR FiVe siX & 8 nine-ten'  // 10
];
```

All approaches output final sentence as: `One Two Three Four Five Six & 8 Nine-ten`

```
function toTitleCase(string) {
    var sentence = string.toLowerCase().split(" ");
    for (var i = 0; i < sentence.length; i++) {
        sentence[i] = sentence[i][0].toUpperCase() + sentence[i].slice(1);
    }
    sentence = sentence.join(" ");
    return sentence;
}

title = toTitleCase(testedString);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='replace'>

```
title = testedString.replace(
    /[a-zA-Z]\S*/g, function(string) {
        return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.substring(1).toLowerCase()
    }
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='ampinssjs'>

```
title = ampScript("SET @Response = ProperCase('" + testedString + "')");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='ampscript'>

```
%%[
SET @Response = ProperCase(@Sentence)
]%%
```

This solution was timed from SSJS Context and used `Variable.SetValue` for passing the testedString to AMPScript Context.

This approach has impact on the exact number of miliseconds, but does not change the final conclusion.

Sentence | SSJS Split | SSJS Replace | AMPScript in SSJS | AMPScript
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 0.0969 | 0.0735 | 0.3828 | 0.1281
2 | 0.1359 | 0.1125 | 0.3797 | 0.1281
3 | 0.1766 | 0.1531 | 0.3829 | 0.1281

5 | 0.2547 | 0.2359 | 0.3891 | 0.1313
6 | 0.2937 | 0.275 | 0.3797 | 0.1281
7 | 0.3344 | 0.3188 | 0.389 | 0.1313

9 | 0.411 | 0.3922 | 0.3843 | 0.1297
10 | 0.45 | 0.436 | 0.3797 | 0.1312

Sum Up:

1. This is huge: __SSJS gets slower which each additional word in the provided sentence. AMPScript execution time is constant.__
2. For one-two word sentences (think First Name, Last Name, Title, etc.) SSJS Replace with Regex is the best solution. Pure AMPScript is very close. Use whichever language you are using for the rest of your code.
3. For anything longer, AMPScript is much better - using it even in SSJS might be great way to optimize speed.
4. Despite [AMPScript in SSJS](./ssjs-snippet-ampscript-in-ssjs.mdx) doing much worse then pure AMPScript, it beats pure SSJS at 9+ words. But as mentioned in the article - use that approach only when there is no other option.
