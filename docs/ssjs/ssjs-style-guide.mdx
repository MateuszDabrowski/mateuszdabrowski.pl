First things first: this Salesforce Marketing Cloud SSJS style guide is highly subjective. You may use it as it is, implement only some parts of it, or ignore it altogether. There are only two rules that I believe are a must-have:

1. Be consistent across your codebase.
2. Strive for good readability.

Everything else is preference. And you are just about to learn about mine.

## Letter Case

SSJS gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to letter case. But instead of going freestyle with that flexibility, you should leverage it to build something meaningful and readable. I decided to focus also on simplicity.

### JS Variables, Functions & Methods Case

__Use `camelCase` for all elements of JS syntax.__

The first category of the elements of your code will be JavaScript (ECMAScript 3 in case of SSJS) native elements. Variables (`var` only), functions (no array goodies), and methods.

For all of those I'm using `camelCase`. It's the most popular convetion, so it will make it easier to work with other programmers, leverage code snippets and onboard new-to-SSJS people to SFMC development.

```js
/* ✅ camelCase for JS syntax */
var variableName = 'Hello World';
function functionName(variableName) {
    return variableName.toLowerCase();
};

/* ❌ Random case */
var VARIABLENAME = 'Hello World';
function FunctionName(variableName) {
    return variableName.tolowercase();
};
```

### SSJS Functions Case

__Use `PascalCase` for all elements of SSJS syntax.__

I take a different approach when working with SSJS Functions from both Platform and Core libraries. For any element coming from those, I use `PascalCase`.

Not only it allows to differentiate between JavaScript native and SFMC custom elements, but it also is aligned with the official SSJS documentation (and therefore most of the snippets you might find).

```js
/* ✅ PamelCase for JS syntax */
Platform.Load('Core', '1');
var dataExtension = DataExtension.Retrieve({
    Property: 'CustomerKey',
    SimpleOperator: 'equals',
    Value: 'dataExtensionExternalKey'
});

/* ❌ Random case */
PLATFORM.LOAD('Core', '1');
var dataExtension = dataextensions.retrieve({
    Property: 'CustomerKey',
    SimpleOperator: 'equals',
    Value: 'dataExtensionExternalKey'
});
```

## Alignment and Indentation

Letter case is just one element of syntax convention that helps with readability. Another huge one is alignment and indentation. JavaScript requires neither, but both can help you write better code.

### Expanded Syntax

__Sparse is better than dense.__

Readability counts. Having less lines is not worth mental gymnastics required to read a condensed code.

```js
/* ✅ Expanded Variable Syntax */
var debugging = {
    request: true,
    response: true,
    error: true
};

/* ❌ Condensed Variable Syntax */
var debugging = { request: true, response: true, error: true };

/* ✅ Expanded Function Syntax */
function debugValue(description, value) {
    Write(description + ': ' + (typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify(value) : value) + '<br><br>');
};

/* ❌ Condensed Function Syntax */
function debugValue(description, value) { Write(description + ': ' + (typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify(value) : value) + '<br><br>'); };

/* ✅ Expanded Try/Catch Syntax */
try {
    var response = HTTP.Get('http://www.example.c');
} catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
};

/* ❌ Condensed Try/Catch Syntax */
try { var response = HTTP.Get('http://www.example.c'); } catch (error) { handleError(error); };
```

:::note You Should Know

I have two exceptions to this rule - both related to `if` statement shorthands.

1. Ternary operator

Ternary simplifies basic `if`/`else` statements, and when used correctly, it should be readable in a single line. If you fear it might be hard to understand, you probably shouldn't use the ternary operator in the first place.

```js
/* ✅ Condensed Ternary Syntax */
typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify(value) : value;

/* ❌ Expanded Ternary Syntax */
typeof value == 'object'
    ? Stringify(value)
    : value;

/* ❌ Too Complex for Ternary Syntax */
debugging ? debugValue(error) : Platform.Function.InsertData('Data_Extension_Name', ['id', 'errorSource', 'errorMessage', 'errorDescription'], [GUID(), 'Name of the place where the script runs', Stringify(error.message), Stringify(error.description)]);
```

2. Single line `if` statements.

Similarly to ternary, single-line if statements also should be used only for basic `if` statements. Whenever there is any complexity (be it `else` statement or just a longer case body), I always go with the expanded syntax.

```js
/* ✅ Condensed Shorthand If Syntax */
if (debugging) debugValue(error);

/* ✅ Expanded Standard If Syntax */
if (debugging) {
    debugValue(error);
} else {
    Platform.Function.InsertData('Data_Extension_Name', ['id', 'errorSource', 'errorMessage', 'errorDescription'], [GUID(), 'Name of the place where the script runs', Stringify(error.message), Stringify(error.description)]);
};

/* ❌ Too Complex for Shorthand If Syntax */
if (response.StatusCode == 200) { var parsedResponse = Platform.Function.ParseJSON(String(response.Response)); if (!parsedResponse.success) throw 'Wrong reCAPTCHA'; };
```

It's up to you to decide how complex is too complex. Whenever in doubt - use expanded syntax.

:::

### Consistent Indentation

__Use indentation to highlight code relationships.__

This rule extends the expanded syntax guide. Don't stop at expanding. Indent. It will help quickly understand what the relationships between the code lines are.

The easy way to implement correct identation is to add a level whenever you open curly bracket and remove one when you close it.

```js
/* ✅ Indented Syntax */
for (var i = 0; i < response.length - 1; i++) {
    var responseRowData = response[i].split(',');
    campaignData.push({
        name: responseRowData[0],
        id: responseRowData[1],
        startDate: responseRowData[2],
        endDate: responseRowData[3]
    });
};

/* ❌ Flat Syntax */
for (var i = 0; i < response.length - 1; i++) {
var responseRowData = response[i].split(',');
campaignData.push({
name: responseRowData[0],
id: responseRowData[1],
startDate: responseRowData[2],
endDate: responseRowData[3]
});
};
```

:::note You Should Know

It's safer to use spaces instead of tabs for indentation. And it's more readable to use 4 spaces instead of 2.

How to do it without killing your space bar? Configure your code editor to output 4 spaces on each Tab button click.

:::

### Intentional Spacing

__Use spaces wherever it makes the code more readable.__

To visually separate elements, use spaces:

- Around operators and curly brackets.
- After commas and keywords (`if`, `while`, `function`).

To provide important context, don't add spaces:

- Inside non-curly brackets.
- Between function name and arguments.

```js
/* ✅ Intentional spacing */
if (response.StatusCode != 200) {
    throw {'message': 'HTTP.Get Error', 'description': 'Could not connect to example.com'}
};

/* ❌ Lack of spacing */
if(response.StatusCode!=200){
    throw{'message':'HTTP.Get Error','description':'Could not connect to example.com'}
};

/* ✅ Intentional spacing */
function debugValue(description, value) {
    Write(description + ': ' + (typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify(value) : value) + '<br><br>');
};

/* ❌ Wrong spacing */
function debugValue ( description, value ) {
    Write ( description + ': ' + ( typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify( value ) : value ) + '<br><br>' );
};
```

## Debatable Styles

Apart from letter case and indentation, some additional style rules are important to consider. Multiple arguments favour various approaches, so feel free not to follow my recommendation as long as you stay consistent across your code.

### Semicolons

__Add a semicolon after each statement.__

The semicolons in JavaScript are optional. You can do without them entirely. But I prefer to use them. Why?

If you do not use semicolons, JS will add them for you using Automatic Semicolon Injection (ASI). In most cases, it's doing this work perfectly, but there might be some situations where it doesn't do what you expected it to do. And that will lead to a very long and frustrating debugging session. If you want to think about ASI when writing, you may ignore semicolons.

If you don't want to worry about ASI, per JS language specification, you should:

- Mark the end of your simple statements with a semicolon `;`. Think variable declarations and operations.
- Don't end complex statements with a semicolon. Think [`if`](./ssjs-if-and-switch#if-statements) statements, [loops](./ssjs-loops.mdx), `functions`, `try/catch` blocks. But... you need a semicolon after the [`do/while` loop](./ssjs-loops.mdx#do-while). Because JavaScript (and yeah, it is different from [`while` loop](.ssjs-loops#while) when considering the statement blocks). Oh, and you will need to add them in your [`for` loop](./ssjs-loops.mdx#for) iteration rules.

That's also a bit to digest and worry about when writing the code. Let's simplify it.

While you don't __need__ a semicolon after complex statements, it won't hurt. It can even help you if you plan to minify the code. So, I recommend adding it after each statement.

```js title="Keep calm and spam semicolons"
/* ✅ Semicolons everywhere */
for (var i = 0; i < response.length - 1; i++) {
    var responseRowData = response[i].split(',');
    campaignData.push({
        name: responseRowData[0],
        id: responseRowData[1],
        startDate: responseRowData[2],
        endDate: responseRowData[3]
    });
};

/* ❌ No semicolons - this will crash due to no semicolons between for iteration rules */
for (var i = 0 i < response.length - 1  i++) {
    var responseRowData = response[i].split(',')
    campaignData.push({
        name: responseRowData[0],
        id: responseRowData[1],
        startDate: responseRowData[2],
        endDate: responseRowData[3]
    })
}
```

### Consistent Quotes

__Choose quote style and be consistent.__

With SSJS, you can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Don't follow Salesforce SSJS documentation - choose one and be consistent.

I prefer single quotes for SSJS due to few reasons:

1. There are many cases where I will use HTML with double quotes as a string variable, and using single quotes means no need to escape them.
2. On most keyboard (including mine), it doesn't require pressing Shift each time.

However, there are also arguments for double quotes:

1. There are many English words using apostrophes, and using double quotes means no need to escape them
2. JSON supports only double-quotes.

In the end, pick one, align with your team, and stay consistent. Yes, this means updating quotes after copy-pasting from Stack Overflow. RegEx is your friend ;)

```js
/* ✅ Single Quotes */
if (response.StatusCode != 200) {
    throw {'message': 'HTTP.Get Error', 'description': 'Could not connect to example.com'};
};

/* ✅ Double Quotes */
if (response.StatusCode != 200) {
    throw {"message": "HTTP.Get Error", "description": "Could not connect to example.com"};
};

/* ❌ Mixed Quotes */
if (response.StatusCode != 200) {
    throw {'message': "HTTP.Get Error", 'description': "Could not connect to example.com"};
};
```
