First things first: this Salesforce Marketing Cloud SSJS style guide is highly subjective. You may use it as it is, implement only some parts of it, or ignore it altogether. There are only two rules that I believe are a must-have:

1. Be consistent across your codebase.
2. Strive for good readability.

Everything else is preference. And you are just about to learn about mine.

## Letter Case

SSJS gives you a lot freedom when it comes to letter case. But instead of going freestyle with that flexibility, you should leverage it to build something meaningful and readable. I decided to focus also on simplicity.

### JS Variables, Functions & Methods Case

First category of the elements of your code will be JavaScript (ECMAScript 3 in case of SSJS) native elements. Variables (`var` only), functions (no array goodies), and methods.

For all of those I'm using `camelCase`. It's the most popular convetion, so it will make it easier to work with other programmers, leverage code snippets and onboard new-to-SSJS people to SFMC development.

```js
var variableName = 'Hello World';
function functionName(variableName) {
    return variableName.toLowerCase();
}
```

### SSJS Functions Case

I take different approach when working with SSJS Functions from both Platform and Core libaries. For any element coming from those, I use `PascalCase`. Not only it allows to differentiate between JavaScript native and SFMC custom elements, but it also is aligned with the official SSJS documentation (and therefore most of the snippets you might find).

```js
Platform.Load('core', '1');
var dataExtension = DataExtension.Retrieve({
    Property: 'CustomerKey',
    SimpleOperator: 'equals',
    Value: 'dataExtensionExternalKey'
});
```

## Alignment and Indentation



### Expanded Syntax

__Sparse is better than dense.__

Readability counts. Having less lines is not worth mental gymnastics required to read condensed code.

```js
/* ✅ Expanded Variable Syntax */
var debugging = {
    request: true,
    response: true,
    error: true
}

/* ❌ Condensed Variable  Syntax */
var debugging = { request: true, response: true, error: true }

/* ✅ Expanded Function Syntax */
function debugValue(description, value) {
    Write(description + ': ' + (typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify(value) : value) + '<br><br>');
}

/* ❌ Condensed Function  Syntax */
function debugValue(description, value) { Write(description + ': ' + (typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify(value) : value) + '<br><br>'); }

/* ✅ Expanded Try/Catch Syntax */
try {
    var response = HTTP.Get('http://www.example.c');
} catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
}

/* ❌ Condensed Try/Catch Syntax */
try { var response = HTTP.Get('http://www.example.c'); } catch (error) { handleError(error); }
```

:::note You Should Know

I have two exceptions tp this rule - both related to `if` statement shorthands.

1. Ternary operator

Ternary is focused on simplifying basic `if`/`else` statements and when used correctly, it should be readable in single line. If you fear it might be hard to understand, you probably shouldn't use ternary operator in the first place.

```js
/* ✅ Condensed Ternary Syntax */
typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify(value) : value;

/* ❌ Expanded Ternary Syntax */
typeof value == 'object'
    ? Stringify(value)
    : value;

/* ❌ Too Complex for Ternary Syntax */
debugging ? debugValue(error) : Platform.Function.InsertData('Data_Extension_Name', ['id', 'errorSource', 'errorMessage', 'errorDescription'], [GUID(), 'Name of the place where the script runs', Stringify(error.message), Stringify(error.description)]);
```

2. Single line `if` statements.

Similarly to ternary, single-line if statements also should be used only for basic `if` statements. Whenever there is any complexity (be it `else` statement or just longer case body), I always go with the expanded syntax.

```js
/* ✅ Condensed Shorthand If Syntax */
if (debugging) debugValue(error);

/* ✅ Expanded Standard If Syntax */
if (debugging) {
    debugValue(error);
} else {
    Platform.Function.InsertData('Data_Extension_Name', ['id', 'errorSource', 'errorMessage', 'errorDescription'], [GUID(), 'Name of the place where the script runs', Stringify(error.message), Stringify(error.description)]);
}

/* ❌ Too Complex for Shorthand If Syntax */
if (response.StatusCode == 200) { var parsedResponse = Platform.Function.ParseJSON(String(response.Response)); if (!parsedResponse.success) throw 'Wrong reCAPTCHA'; }
```

It's up to you to decide how complex is too complex. Whenever in doubt - use expanded syntax.

### Consistent Indentation

__Use indentation to highlight code relationships.__

This rule extends the expanded syntax guide. Don't stop at expanding. Indent. It will help quickly understand what are the relationships betwen the code lines.

The easy way to implement correct identation is to add a level whenever you open curly bracket and remove one when you close it.

```js
/* ✅ Indented Syntax */
for (var i = 0; i < response.length - 1; i++) {
    var responseRowData = response[i].split(',');
    campaignData.push({
        name: responseRowData[0],
        id: responseRowData[1],
        startDate: responseRowData[2],
        endDate: responseRowData[3]
    });
}

/* ❌ Flat Syntax */
for (var i = 0; i < response.length - 1; i++) {
var responseRowData = response[i].split(',');
campaignData.push({
name: responseRowData[0],
id: responseRowData[1],
startDate: responseRowData[2],
endDate: responseRowData[3]
});
}
```

### Intentional Spacing

__Use spaces wherever it makes the code more readable.__

Use spaces between operators, around curly brackets and after keywords (`if`, `while`, `function`). It helps separate elements.
Don't add them inside non-curly brackets or between function name and arguments. It helps with understanding context.

```js
/* ✅ Intentional spacing */
if (response.StatusCode != 200) {
    throw {'message': 'HTTP.Get Error', 'description': 'Could not connect to example.com'}
}

/* ❌ Lack of spacing */
if(response.StatusCode!=200){
    throw{'message':'HTTP.Get Error','description':'Could not connect to example.com'}
}

/* ✅ Intentional spacing */
function debugValue(description, value) {
    Write(description + ': ' + (typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify(value) : value) + '<br><br>');
}

/* ❌ Wrong spacing */
function debugValue ( description, value ) {
    Write ( description + ': ' + ( typeof value == 'object' ? Stringify( value ) : value ) + '<br><br>' );
}
```

### Consistent Quotes

__Choose quote style and be consistent.__

With SSJS you can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Don't follow Salesforce SSJS documentation - choose one and be consistent.

I prefere single quotes for SSJS due to few reasons:

1. There are many cases, where I will use HTML with double quotes as a string variable, and using single quotes means no need to escape them.
2. On most keyboard (including mine) it doesn't require pressing Shift each time.

However there are also arguments for double quotes:

1. There are many english words using apostrophes, and using double quotes means no need to escape them
2. JSON supports only double quotes.

In the end, pick one, align with your team, and stay consistent. Yes, this means updating quotes after copy-pasting from Stack Overflow. RegEx is your friend ;)

```js
/* ✅ Single Quotes */
if (response.StatusCode != 200) {
    throw {'message': 'HTTP.Get Error', 'description': 'Could not connect to example.com'}
}

/* ✅ Double Quotes */
if (response.StatusCode != 200) {
    throw {"message": "HTTP.Get Error", "description": "Could not connect to example.com"}
}

/* ❌ Mixed Quotes */
if (response.StatusCode != 200) {
    throw {'message': "HTTP.Get Error", 'description': "Could not connect to example.com"}
}
```
