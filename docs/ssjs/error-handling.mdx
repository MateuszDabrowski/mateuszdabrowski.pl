When you start working with programmatic languages in Salesforce Marketing Cloud, you will quickly become close friends with Error 500 page. And if you beat it and go a bit deeper into the code and official documentation, you will also fall in love with unexpected errors in function and API responses. How to survive those?

## SSJS Testing Ground

Let's talk where to write the SSJS. The language is useful in many places within the Marketing Cloud ecosystem, among else:

- Cloud Pages (Web Studio)
- Code Resources (Web Studio)
- Content Blocks (Content Builder)
- Emails and other communication (Email Studio / Content Builder)
- Script Activities (Automation Studio)

In all of the above cases, you might write more complex logic that will be error-prone and in need of debugging. However, only a few of those are good to test your code, as only some of them will allow you to leverage the methods mentioned later in the article.

### Cloud Page

The most popular recommendation is Cloud Page - write or paste the SSJS code there, publish and check whether it is working correctly. It is a great way, as it allows you to easily leverage SSJS for backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend.

It has, however, two flaws that, in some scenarios, might guide you to a different solution.

1. **Cost**. Each view of the Cloud Page cost one Super Message. During debugging, you might hit quite a lot of those. And those tests across your team and over time stack up.
2. **Speed and context**. Each time you want to republish updated Cloud Page you have to go through the Preview windows that load the whole code in POST method context, confirm it and go to the page via URL to see GET method context.

### JSON Code Resource

When I want to go around those issues, I go with JSON Code Resource (also available in Web Studio). It generates a link you can use to check whether everything works just as a Cloud Page. However, page views are free. There is also no preview allowing for faster save-reload.

The cons? You won't be able to use any frontend (neither HTML nor JavaScript), which might be a deal-breaker in some scripts that you want to test.

### So where?

If you need | Cloud Page | JSON Code Resource
-- | -- | --
SSJS | ✅ | ✅
HTML/CSS/JS | ✅ | ❌
No Cost |  ❌ | ✅
Quick Save | ❌ | ✅

:::note Email Studio

Some also use Email Studio for testing various scripts, but I recommend against it. It doesn't support SSJS Core Library. Even if you don't need it for your script, it is very useful for debugging.

## 500 - Internal Server Error

TODO: Validate and inform why try/catch won't solve 500

The first type of error you might encounter is the dreaded 500 Error that you see right after *trying* to run your code. Reason? The code backend (SSJS/AMPScript) is invalid. There might be a few reasons for this. The most popular are:

1. Typo in SSJS Function Name
2. Unclosed or wrongly closed Bracket
3. Use of JavaScript feature that is not available in SSJS (and there is quite a lot of those...)
4. Lack of declaration (in most cases either missing `Platform.Load("Core","1");` or `var soap = new Script.Util.WSProxy();` while using related functions)

How to deal with those issues? Apart from just reading through your code line by line, there are two faster solutions.

### Divide and Conquer

The first one can be done directly in the Marketing Cloud but is a bit of a brute-force approach. You comment out half of your code with `/* here goes the code */` and check again. If it works, you have half of the SSJS validated (from the 500 error perspective). If not, you split the remaining code in half and comment it out. This way, you can quite quickly find the few lines that are leading to the issue and focus only on them.

### SSJS Linting

For many of the reasons leading to 500 error, there is an even faster solution, but with some pre-requisites:

1. You need to have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Visual Studio Code Website") with [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint "ESLint in Visual Studio Code Marketplace") installed.
2. You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/ "NodeJS Website") installed.
3. You need to have a folder where you will store your SSJS code in files with `.ssjs` file extension.
4. You need to install the excellent [ESLing configuration for SSJS](https://github.com/JoernBerkefeld/eslint-config-ssjs "Joern Berkefeld Github Project with Config") made by [Joern Berkefeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joernberkefeld/ "Joern Berkefeld LinkedIn"). To do this, run in terminal `npx i -D eslint eslint-config-ssjs` for the SSJS folder.

Voila, automatic SSJS code validation (again, only from the perspective of 500 error - but it is still worth it).

TODO: Validate whether Script Automation might be simplified work around

## Write the Error down

Once we get past the 500 error, it is time to check what else might be wrong. The easiest way is to use the Write function. It shows whatever you pass in it to the frontend view. This is why, it is good to leverage choose right [Testing Ground](#ssjs-testing-ground). It is especially useful, SSJS does not support console.log due to it server-side nature (a little trick to make it work will be soon).

To use this function, within `<script runat=server>` and `</script>` add `Write('This will be visible on the website')`.

Of course, in real life, you will probably want to use it for variables:

```html {4}
<script runat=server>
    Platform.Load('Core','1');
    var response = HTTP.Get('http://www.example.com');
    Write('Response from example.com' + response + '<br><br>');
</script>
```

:::note Few things to remember

1. `Write` is Core Library function, so you need to load it in your script.
2. As all Core Library functions, it will not function in Emails or SMS.
3. If the variable you want to write is an object, you need to parse it to string using `Platform.Function.ParseJSON(response)`.

:::

You probably saw that in the code snippet above I not only have `response` in my `Write`. There is also short description before it and `<br><br>` after. I highly recommend this approach. First element will help you understand what is printed (especially if you use multiple Writes in yoru code). The second will separete it from the rest of the website content (however, it won't work in JSON Code Resource, as it is HTML).

### Debugging Variable

Whenever you are creating a script that will be used for longer time, it is worth to keep your debugging `Write` functions. Data sources you use change. Marketing Cloud itself too. And sometime this might break your code.

Of course, you don't won't your customers to see those, but there is a neat little trick:

```html {3,7}
<script runat=server>
    Platform.Load('Core','1');
    var debugging = true;

    var response = HTTP.Get('http://www.example.com');

    if (debugging) {
        Write('Response from example.com' + response + '<br><br>');
    }
</script>
```

As you can see I changed here two things.
1. There is `var debugging = true` near the top. This is our variable that will allow us to control whether `Write` writes. When debugging, keep it on `true`. When you publish it for production - change the value to `false`.
2. The above value will be used in second new element - the `if` statement. It checks what is the value of `debugging` variable and runs `Write` only if it is `true`.

### Console Logging

I mentioned before that SSJS does not support `console.log` as it is executing on server. There is however a trick, that might bring the SSJS values to your console. Leverage SSJS personalization in your JavaScript:

```js
console.log('Response from example.com' + <ctrl:var name=response /> )
```
