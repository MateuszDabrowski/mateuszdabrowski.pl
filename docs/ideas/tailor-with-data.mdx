## Leverage the data

Most Marketing Automation tools allow you to use the contact and account data for personalization. Inserting a user-specific value from a data model to landing page or e-mail? Creating custom content tailored to the user? Easy and simple. [Eloqua](https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/marketing-automation/ "Oracle Eloqua Marketing Automation Platform")'s [Field Merges](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAA/Help/FieldMerges/FieldMerges.htm "Field Merge Documentation") or [Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/products/marketing-cloud/overview/ "Salesforce Marketing Cloud Platform")'s personalization strings are made for it. But you can do so much more!

### Change the structure of the landing page
Part of your subscription centre should be visible only to your clients? Instead of creating and managing two separate pages, you can use personalization to check whether the visitor has any license and unhide product-related data & subscription section.

### Create a genuinely dynamic form
Not keen on asking your customers, again and again, the same questions in your content form? Use personalization to hide form fields that won't give you new knowledge. The shorter the form, the better.

### Enrich your data
You got multi picklist storing information on topics that are interesting to your customers? Want to use white paper download form to add such data point? Sure, all Marketing Automation Platforms have form processing that will be able to append such value. But unfortunately, it in most it is not possible to check whether it already is added to that field. You guessed it, personalization with a simple script can fix it.

## Script your solution

Time to create a script that will solve the problems mentioned above. Firstly, you will need to get the data from your data model.

<Tabs
    groupId='marketingAutomationPlatforms'
    defaultValue='sfmc'
    values={[
        {label: 'Salesforce Marketing Cloud', value: 'sfmc'},
        {label: 'Oracle Eloqua', value: 'eloqua'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='sfmc'>

For Marketing Cloud, the easiest way is to use the personalization string. The code is straightforward:

```html
<ctrl:field name=ProfileAttributeName />
```

The only thing you need is the name of ProfileAttribute or field from source Sendable Data Extension. It gets a bit more elaborate if you want to leverage other source, but absolutely viable. You can use Lookup function to capture data points from other Data Extensions. Even Salesforce Objects are in the scope with a bit of AMPScript.

In most places of Marketing Cloud you can leverage built-in menu to add such personalization string (in its AMPScript version).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='eloqua'>

For Eloqua, the easiest way is to use the Field Merge. The code is straightforward:

```html
<span class=eloquaemail>​Field_Merge_Name1​</span>
```

The only thing you need is the Field Merge name. Unfortunately, you can not add the asset name, as Eloqua is using in the code the automatically created HTML name.

In most cases it is very similar to the original Field Merge name, in some - like Field Merge created by copying another one - can be a surprise. To be sure you have the correct name I recommended creating an empty HTML landing page and drag and drop the Field Merge onto HTML editor. It will add whole needed code for you.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To create a script that will allow for three use cases mentioned in the first part of the post, we need one more thing - an `id` attribute. Some elements will already have it (for example, in Eloqua each form field exists in separate div element: `<div id="formElement1" ...>`). The rest will need you to add it to the HTML manually.

:::note You Should Know

You are not limited to `id` attribute. You can leverage any attribute and caputre it with `document.querySelector()` or `document.querySelectorAll()`. Capturing `class` is great to change multiple parts of the website at once.

:::

With personalization code and value of the `id` attribute at hand, we can start the (short) scripting.

### Hiding elements on the website

<Tabs
    groupId='marketingAutomationPlatforms'
    defaultValue='sfmc'
    values={[
        {label: 'Salesforce Marketing Cloud', value: 'sfmc'},
        {label: 'Oracle Eloqua', value: 'eloqua'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='sfmc'>

```html title="Hide element with id='idName' if viewers EmailOptedIn attribute has value 'True'"
<script>
    window.addEventListener('load', () => { // 1.
        if ('<ctrl:field name=EmailOptedIn />' === 'True') { // 2.
            document.querySelector("#idValue").display = "none"; // 3.
        };
    };
</script>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='eloqua'>

```html title="Hide element with id='idName' if viewers EmailOptedIn field has value 'True'"
<script>
    window.addEventListener('load', () => { // 1.
        if ('<span class=eloquaemail>EmailOptedIn1</span>' === 'True') { //2.
            document.querySelector("#idValue").display = "none"; // 3.
        };
    };
</script>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Above script has three important lines that deserve some explanation.

First one tells the web browser to launch the logic only after the whole page loaded. It is very important, as it guarantees that the website element you want to hide was already rendered by the browser.

Next is the `if` statement. It evaluates the value stored in the data model received via personalization (left side of ==) with another value we choose (right side of ==). In this case, it checks whether Email Opted In for a particular user is set to True (that value may differ in your data model).

Third line looks for an HTML element with id equal to `'idValue'` and hides it from the user.

:::note You Should Know

You can adapt this script to do almost anything. Once you have your element selected with `querySelector` you can programmatically change its value, add or remove a class from it to impact the CSS applied or even add or remove elements around it.

:::

With this script, you can both modify the structure of your landing page and alter the form fields (or even just form field options) visible for the user. Hide some elements, show other, change the style of a web element to make it more prominent on the website. But that is not all!

### Changing elements on the website

For our data enrichment use case, we will need to alter the script slightly.

<Tabs
    groupId='marketingAutomationPlatforms'
    defaultValue='sfmc'
    values={[
        {label: 'Salesforce Marketing Cloud', value: 'sfmc'},
        {label: 'Oracle Eloqua', value: 'eloqua'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='sfmc'>

```html title="Change value of a hidden form field if Profile Attribute value includes 'Tax'"
<script>
    window.addEventListener('load', () => { // 1.
        const regexSearchValue = /Tax/; // 2.
        if (regexSearchValue.test("<ctrl:var name=Interests />")) { // 3.
            document.querySelector("#alreadyInterested").value = 'True'; // 4.
        };
    };
</script>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='eloqua'>

```html title="Change value of a hidden form field if Field Merge value includes 'Tax'"
<script>
    window.addEventListener('load', () => { // 1.
        const regexSearchValue = /Tax/; // 2.
        if (regexSearchValue.test("<span class=eloquaemail>Interests1</span>")) { // 3.
            document.querySelector("#alreadyInterested").value = 'True'; // 4.
        };
    };
</script>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this scenario we have a multipicklist field `Interests` that captures what captivates specific customer. If the is fascinated by more than one topic, the names are semicolon separated. Nice marketing tactic is to enrich this list each time the customer engages with something directly related to a particular topic. For example downloads whitepaper deep-diving on taxes.

In most Marketing Automation Platforms it is really easy to just append interest to such field. This, however, leads to a (quite big) possibility of having the same interest added multiple times. And this is neither good from the data quality perspective nor field length compliance.

So how to use the above script to enrich your data cleanly? We will need a hidden form field inside the white paper download form. In the form HTML look for input attribute of this hidden field (`<input id="alreadyInterested" type="hidden" ...>`). The `id` attribute will be useful again.

You already know the first line from previous section. The new things come next. We declare value we want to check in our data model picklist. In this example, we will test whether the user is already interested in Tax topic. The `/` before and after the word are special characters used for [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions "MDN Documentation on Regular_Expressions").

The third line is the fastest way to check whether the declared value is already in `Interests` field. If it is, then the script will evaluate the line below.

Finally, in case of the value already being in the multi picklist, we put True inside the hidden form field. With it is done, we can then utilise form processing to append new interest conditionally - only if hidden field is blank in the submission data.

## Create conditional logic

Simple manipulation of visibility and values on your landing page is just beginning. You can get even more out of scripted personalizations and take control over user & data flows.

Looking for an excellent way to tell your Google Analytics whether the user just downloaded a white paper or did he also wanted to receive product presentation on top of that? Not keen on creating two mirror-like thank you pages with different conversion script? Sure!

Your form should have a processing step that appends date stamp to a data model field in case of the user becoming a lead (asking for a product presentation). This data, apart from being a great source of knowledge for your lead reporting and data processing trigger, will be handy for this solution.

```html
<script>
    var leadCreationDate = "<span class=eloquaemail>LeadCreationTriggerDate1</span>";
    if (Date.now() - new Date(leadCreationDate) < 22680000) {
        dataLayer.push({
            // Your Lead conversion dataLayer model
        });
    } else {
        dataLayer.push({
            // Your Whitepaper conversion dataLayer model
        });
    }
</script>
```

Sample code required trigger Google Analytics conversion dataLayers conditionally
Why? Because you can check how distant in the past the Field Merged date is. And if it is within minutes, you can be pretty sure the user just became your lead. Which tells the script to push the lead conversion data layer instead of the whitepaper data layer. Simple and quick.
Eloqua is applying the date in their servers timezone (CET/CEST).

### Possibilities are endless.

Want to be sure only recognised users will enter your subscription centre? Add e-mail address Field Merge. If it is empty, it means Eloqua did not recognise this user. JavaScript can automatically redirect him to your subscription centre entry form.

```js
 if ("<span class=eloquaemail>​EmailAddress​</span>" == "") {
    window.location.replace(​"https://redirect.here")
}
```

Want to push some information from a data model to an external page? Field Merge that data and use JavaScript to append it to redirect link as a query string.

You can get even more power with using dynamic content (perfect for simplifying javascript logic) or web data lookups (allows you to leverage e-mail group subscription, shared list audience › even on external websites). Imagination is the only limit.
