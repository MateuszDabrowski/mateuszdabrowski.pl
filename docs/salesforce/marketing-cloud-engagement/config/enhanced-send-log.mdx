## What is Send Log

Send Log is a table that captures relevant data about sends happening in the platform. In the case of Salesforce Marketing Cloud, it is a unique Data Extension that automatically captures the data (no need for AMPScript or SSJS to populate it).

SFMC doesn't have Send Log out of the box, but you can make one yourself. On the first screen of Data Extension creation, select `Create From Template` in the `Creation Method` field. You will see a picklist with multiple templates, including `SendLog` (for Emails), `SMSSendLog` and `PushSendLog`. If you do not see any of those templates - you might need to request this as a free [feature on demand](./sfmc-features-on-demand.mdx).

Once you create it, it will automatically populate with each attempted send originating from its Business Unit.

### Send Log Data Extension Template

The Send Log template comes with six default fields:

| Name | Type | Length | Primary Key | Nullable |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| JobID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| ListID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| BatchID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| SubID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| TriggeredSendID | String | 36 | | Yes |
| ErrorCode | Numeric | | | Yes |

`JobID` and `BatchID` allow you to differentiate the send if you push the same email on multiple days or campaigns.

`ListID` contains the ID of the list used for the send (for example, All Subscribers list).

`SubID` contains Subscriber ID - a unique Subscriber identifier, different from Subscriber Key. Subscriber ID is a backend system number that we cannot change.

`TriggeredSendID` stores the ID of a Triggered Send Definition if it was used for the specific send.

`ErrorCode` captures an error that stopped a specific send. I have added the list of all possible codes with an explanation [at the bottom](#send-log-errorcode-values).

:::note You Should Know

If your send was not delivered, but you can see it in the Send Log without any `ErrorCode`, leverage [Email Sends Debugging Query](../sql/snippets/sfmc-sql-debugging-email-sends.mdx) to learn what happened with the message.

### Send Log vs _Sent System Data View

You might wonder - why use email Send Log when [_Sent Data View](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#_sent) captures the same data out of the box? There are two reasons.

#### 1. Captured data is not precisely the same.

It's not only about the [`ErrorCode` field](#send-log-errorcode-values) in the Send Log, and multiple additional fields in the [_Sent Data View](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#_sent). It's also about when the data is captured.

Send Log is populated when SFMC prepares the send. That's why it can log [ErrorCode](#send-log-errorcode-values) if the send fails. The Data View is populated later when SFMC pushes a correctly constructed email out to the Email Service Providers.

It means that Send Log is an incredible tool to check why some emails did not go out of SFMC.

#### 2. You can customise the Send Log

Data Views are set in stone (unless you purchase a [custom one](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#custom-data-views)), but you can add fields to the Send Log to align it better with your business needs. Let's dive into how it works and why you should use it.

## Custom Send Log

The true power of Send Log lies in the possibility to customise it. The default six columns are just beginning - you can add additional ones per your business needs. With performance in mind, I would recommend adding up to 5 custom fields.

Columns added to Send Log are unique because you can make them fill in automatically. How does it work?

When Marketing Cloud prepares the email for sending, Send Log evaluates all available [personalisation strings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&type=5&id=sf.mc_es_available_personalization_strings.htm), Sendable Data Extension fields and AMPScript variables. Each value that shares a name with Send Log column is automatically filled. Examples?

1. If you want to capture the recipient's Email Address in the SendLog, you can add the `EmailAddr` field, and it will be automatically filled thanks to `%%emailaddr%%` personalisation string.

2. Capturing Subscriber Key is a bit tricky, as the personalisation string is `%%_subscriberkey%%` - you cannot add a field starting with the underscore to Data Extension. There are two ways to capture this information. In most cases, you will have the `SubscriberKey` field in the Data Extension used for sending - you can use the same column name in the Send Log. Alternatively, you can create an AMPScript variable using the personalisation string: `SET @SubscriberKey = AttributeValue('_subscriberkey')`. Send Log will pick up your AMPScript variable and fill the column.

3. You can also use AMPScript variables for other interesting things, like capturing information from Additional Email Attributes or custom values manually configured within the email body.

:::note You Should Know

In most cases, you can dry-test automatic filling by adding `%%[Output(Concat('SendLogColumnName: ', @SendLogColumnName))]%%` to the bottom of the email (where `SendLogColumnName` is equal to the Send Log field you want to test). This AMPScript one-liner should output `SendLogColumnName: ` along with the value that SFMC would add to the Send Log. If it doesn't - there might not be an appropriate variable, or it is not assigned a value.

### Customised Send Log Example

Here you can see sample Customised Send Log that I like to use:

| Name | Type | Length | Primary Key | Nullable |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| JobID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| ListID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| BatchID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| SubID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| TriggeredSendID | String | 36 | | Yes |
| ErrorCode | Numeric | | | Yes |
| SubscriberKey | String | 18 | | Yes |
| EmailAddr | Email | 254 | | Yes |
| EmailName_ | String | 150 | | Yes |
| LogDate | Date | | | |
| BusinessSpecificField1 | | | | Yes |
| BusinessSpecificField2 | | | | Yes |

I always add the `SubscriberKey` field (filled from a column of the same name in the Data Extension used for send) along with `EmailAddr` and `EmailName_` fields filled in from personalisation strings. I also add `LogDate` field filled with current date as default to be able to filter rows based on a attempted send date.

As Send Log will show the data as it is at the moment of email preparation, I frequently extend it with customer-specific fields that are crucial for send-time data checks. For example - VIP status, Contact vs Lead status, assigned Account Executive.

All those data points can be beneficial during debugging. VIP offer sent to the standard customer? Send Log will tell you whether the Subscriber was VIP at the moment of send or it is a bug in your Journey criteria.

:::note You Should Know

Another handy field that I would love to capture in the Send Log would be the name of the Data Extension used for the send. It should be possible, as there is a dedicated personalisation string: `%%_DataSourceName%%`. But...

You can add the `DataSourceName` field to Send Log and `SET @DataSourceName = AttributeValue('_datasourcename')` snippet to the email. However, it will work correctly only for the Send Flow.

Unfortunately, it currently does not support Journey Builder Sends. Learn more and vote for a fix [here](../../../sites/ideas/marketing-cloud-ideas/#_datasourcename-for-entry-data-extension-in-journey-builder).

## Enhanced Send Log

Custom Send Log is already a fantastic tool, but it's more suited for administrators with its technical field names and lack of post-send data. However, you can easily leverage it to create something perfect for your more business-oriented SFMC users.

To do it, you will need additional Data Extension and simple Automation with single Query Activity.

### Enhanced Send Log Example

Create standard Data Extension with more user-friendly names and extend it with journey and engagement data points:

| Name | Type | Length | Primary Key | Nullable |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| SubscriberKey | String | 18 | Yes | No |
| SubscriberID | Numeric | | | Yes |
| EmailAddress | Email | 254 | | Yes |
| BusinessSpecificField1 | | | | Yes |
| BusinessSpecificField2 | | | | Yes |
| EmailName | String | 150 | | Yes |
| JourneyName | String | 100 | | Yes |
| JourneyVersion | String | 100 | | Yes |
| LogDate | Date | | | Yes |
| SentDate | Date | | | Yes |
| Delivered | String | 20 | | Yes |
| FirstOpenDate | Date | | | Yes |
| FirstClickDate | Date | | | Yes |
| BounceDate | Date | | | Yes |
| JobID | Numeric | | Yes | Yes |
| ListID | Numeric | | Yes | Yes |
| BatchID | Numeric | | Yes | Yes |
| TriggeredSendID | String | 36 | | Yes |
| ErrorCode | Numeric | | | Yes |

### Enhanced Send Log SQL Query Activity

Create Automation with Query Activity that will take data from your technical [template-based Send Log](#send-log-data-extension-template) and [System Data Views](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx) to populate your Enhanced Send Log DE with actionable data.

```sql
SELECT
      sl.SubscriberKey          AS SubscriberKey
    , sl.SubID                  AS SubscriberID
    , sl.EmailAddr              AS EmailAddress
    , sl.BusinessSpecificField1 AS BusinessSpecificField1
    , sl.BusinessSpecificField2 AS BusinessSpecificField2
    , sl.EmailName              AS EmailName
    , j.JourneyName             AS JourneyName
    , j.VersionNumber           AS JourneyVersion
    , sl.LogDate                AS LogDate
    , s.EventDate               AS SentDate
    , CASE
        WHEN s.EventDate IS NULL THEN 'False'
        WHEN job.DeliveredTime IS NOT NULL THEN CONVERT(NVARCHAR, job.DeliveredTime)
        WHEN  b.EventDate IS NOT NULL THEN 'False'
        WHEN  o.EventDate IS NOT NULL OR  c.EventDate IS NOT NULL THEN 'True'
        WHEN  s.EventDate > DATEADD(MINUTE, -15, GETDATE()) THEN 'Pending'
        ELSE 'True'
      END                       AS Delivered
    , CASE
        WHEN o.EventDate IS NOT NULL THEN o.EventDate
        WHEN c.EventDate IS NOT NULL THEN c.EventDate
      END                       AS FirstOpenDate
    , c.EventDate               AS FirstClickDate
    , b.EventDate               AS BounceDate
    , sl.JobID                  AS JobID
    , sl.ListID                 AS ListID
    , sl.BatchID                AS BatchID
    , sl.TriggeredSendID        AS TriggeredSendID
    , sl.ErrorCode              AS ErrorCode
FROM TechnicalSendLog AS sl
    LEFT JOIN _Job AS job
        ON sl.JobID = job.JobID
    LEFT JOIN _Sent AS s
        ON sl.JobID = s.JobID
        AND sl.ListID = s.ListID
        AND sl.BatchID = s.BatchID
        AND sl.SubID = s.SubscriberID
    LEFT JOIN _Open AS o
        ON s.JobID = o.JobID
        AND s.ListID = o.ListID
        AND s.BatchID = o.BatchID
        AND s.SubscriberID = o.SubscriberID
        AND o.IsUnique = 1
    LEFT JOIN _Click AS c
        ON s.JobID = c.JobID
        AND s.ListID = c.ListID
        AND s.BatchID = c.BatchID
        AND s.SubscriberID = c.SubscriberID
        AND c.IsUnique = 1
    LEFT JOIN _Bounce AS b
        ON s.JobID = b.JobID
        AND s.ListID = b.ListID
        AND s.BatchID = b.BatchID
        AND s.SubscriberID = b.SubscriberID
        AND b.IsUnique = 1
    LEFT JOIN _JourneyActivity AS ja
        ON s.TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID = ja.JourneyActivityObjectID
    LEFT JOIN _Journey AS j
        ON ja.VersionID = j.VersionID
WHERE
    sl.SubscriberKey IS NOT NULL
    AND CONVERT(DATE, sl.LogDate) >= DATEADD(MONTH, -1, CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE()))
```

In the above query, we pull Journey Builder information and Sent, Delivered, Open, Click, Bounce information. We are also adding a custom logic that will provide more real Delivery and Open data using the fundamental assumption that if the recipient clicked something - the email had to be delivered and opened.

In the [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) section, we filter the data to pull only updates for sends from the last month to optimise the query performance.

Schedule that Automation nightly and share the Enhanced Send Log with your users.
