<LeadText content='Dive deep into System Data Views - the backend Marketing Cloud data. Actionable pearls await.' />

## Data Views Basics

System Data Views are **built-in backend Data Extensions** that you can use to find information about your subscribers and sends. You **cannot change them**, but you can leverage their data in SQL queries for quick reports in [Query Studio](docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/config/appexchange-solutions.mdx#query-studio) or outputting to the standard Data Extension. They are excellent fuel for SSJS logic.

Data Views have **data retention settings set to 6 months**. If you want to store any data for a more extended period, you must create an Automation that will be copying data to your Data Extension.

Be careful, however, as some of the System Data Views can get absurdly big quick, and making copies within your Marketing Cloud Instance may lead to performance issues. In such cases, a much better idea might be to export that data on a scheduled basis to an external Data Warehouse.

Another important point related to Data Views is always knowing which Data View you genuinely want to use. For example, in most cases, you will be interested in parent-level [`_Subscribers`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-from.mdx#enterprise-data-extension) prefix in your query.

:::note You Should Know

Below you can find selected Salesforce Marketing Cloud Data Views focused on Subscribers, Journeys, Email and SMS Channel. I plan to cover the rest of them in the future.

Be sure to check the excellent [Dataviews.io](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx).

There is also a more detailed [System Tables relationship diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5ff259ed80d742080a34e3c3) created by [Cameron Roberts](https://cameronrobert.com.au) that contains SQL Database structure along with field lengths.

## Subscriber Data Views

### _Subscribers

Stores information about your Subscribers. Great for high-level perspective or adding Email Address field to other more detailed Data Views.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        { label: 'Fields', value: 'fields' },
        { label: 'Field Picklist Values', value: 'values' },
        { label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql' },
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
DateUndeliverable | The date an email for the subscriber was returned as undeliverable | Date | X
DateJoined | The Date, the subscriber, joined your list | Date | X
DateUnsubscribed | The Date, the subscriber, unsubscribed from your list | Date | X
Domain | The domain of the subscriber | Text | X
EmailAddress | The subscriber's email address | Email |
BounceCount | The total number of bounces accrued by the subscriber | Number |
SubscriberKey | A potential alternate identifier for subscribers. | Text |
SubscriberType | The subscriber type for the affected subscriber | Text |
Status | The status of the subscriber | Text | X
Locale | The locale code for the subscriber | Locale | X


</TabItem>
<TabItem value='values'>

`Status` possible values:
- active
- held
- unsubscribed
- bounced

`SubscriberType` possible values:
- ExactTarget
- Unknown External System
In most cases you will see only `Exact Target` in your database.

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      sub.SubscriberID
    , sub.DateUndeliverable
    , sub.DateJoined
    , sub.DateUnsubscribed
    , sub.Domain
    , sub.EmailAddress
    , sub.BounceCount
    , sub.SubscriberKey
    , sub.SubscriberType
    , sub.Status
    , sub.Locale
FROM _Subscribers AS sub
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Subscribers` Data View:

1. If you are using the query in the child Business Unit, use [`Ent.`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-from.mdx#enterprise-data-extension) prefix, as the data is stored on Parent BU level.
2. If you need high-level data on your subscribers, this Data View might be enough. If you want to learn more (/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) other Data Views.
3. Use `SubscriberID` to [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) data from different engagement-based Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) or [`_Bounce`](#_bounce).
4. The `Status` field is excellent for a quick check of your database quality. It is also nice to manage multiple records. Pull the selection of your subscribers with SQL Query, add a new status with [custom value](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-select.mdx#custom-values) (for example, `'unsubscribed' AS Status`) and leverage Automation to export-transfer-import the Data Extension to All Subscribers.
5. This Data View, along with [`_EnterpriseAttribute`](#_enterpriseattribute), [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes`](#_businessunitunsubscribes) and [`_ListSubscribers`](#_listsubscribers), does not have six-month data retention.

---

### _EnterpriseAttribute

Stores information about your Profile and Preference Attributes from Email Studio.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        { label: 'Fields', value: 'fields' },
        { label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql' },
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
_SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record stored. | Number

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      ea._SubscriberID                     AS SubscriberID
    , ea.ProfileAttributeWithoutSpaces
    , ea.[Profile Attribute With Spaces]   AS ProfileAttributeWithSpace
    , ea.PreferenceAttributeWithoutSpaces
    , ea.[Preference Attribute With Spaces]   AS PreferenceAttributeWithSpace
FROM _EnterpriseAttribute AS ea
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


When working with `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View:

1. If you are using the query in the child Business Unit, always use `ENT.` prefix as it is enterprise-level only Data View.
2. When querying or joining `_EnterpriseAttribute`, always include the underscore before SubscriberID - this is the only Data View that requires it.
3. Despite the `Email Address` field is visible in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI when you go to Profile Attributes, it is not part of the `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View. To get the Email Address of your Subscriber, query the `_Subscribers` Data View.
4. Unfortunately, the default Preference Attribute `HTML Email` is not accessible via query.
5. `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View is unique, as it might contain spaces in field names. You build it by creating the Profile Attributes in Email Studio. If your profile attribute name contains space, you will have to use the square bracket notation to capture it: `SELECT [Attribute With Spaces] FROM _EnterpriseAttribute`.
6. This Data View, along with [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers), [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes`](#_businessunitunsubscribes) and [`_ListSubscribers`](#_listsubscribers) , does not have six-month data retention.

FROM _Job AS job
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Job` Data View:

1. `JobID` field will be your bread and butter to [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) with other engagement-based Data Views.
2. `EmailName`, `FromName`, and `FromEmail` are handy data points missing in the [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click), [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) Data Views and are worth checking for reporting needs.
3. If you are performing A/B tests or want to analyse the subject line's impact on performance, be sure to pick `EmailSubject`. Pair it with [`CASE`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-case.mdx#conditional-values-with-case) to create a great knowledge source for your content team.
4. For debugging purposes, be sure to check out `IsWrapped` and `SuppressTracking` - if you are missing tracking data, `CharacterSet` - if you have problems with formatting, `SendClassification` - if you have issues with unsubscribers or spam complaints.
5. `AccountUserID` field is fantastic for `_Job`-based Audit Log creation. Unfortunately, there is no UI-based easy way to determine which user has which UserID. You can either use SOAP API or match based on these SQL results.

:::note You Should Know

`_Job` Data View is unique among other Email-focused Data Views, as it shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_Job`. You can query only those jobs that occurred in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always consider this when choosing Business Unit to execute the query and the type of [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) statement.

### _Sent

Stores information about your Email Sends. Great for understanding who had a chance to receive your message and whose communication did not leave your system.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        { label: 'Fields', value: 'fields' },
        { label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql' },
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
AccountID | Your parent account ID (MID) number | Number |
OYBAccountID | The account ID (MID) number of the child Business Unit that owns the data. If queried on parent Business Unit, it will be `Null` | Number | X
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the send took place | Date |
Domain | The domain at which the send occurred | Text |
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Text | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      sent.AccountID
    , sent.OYBAccountID
    , sent.JobID
    , sent.ListID
    , sent.BatchID
    , sent.SubscriberID
    , sent.SubscriberKey
    , sent.EventDate
    , sent.Domain
    , sent.TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID
    , sent.TriggeredSendCustomerKey
FROM _Sent AS sent
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Sent` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Open`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/snippets/sql-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. The most valuable data here is the `EventDate` field that lets you know when the email was sent (and whether that happened at all).
3. If you have triggered a send for an email and after a few minutes you don't see it here, in most cases, it means that the send was blocked and never left Marketing Cloud. Check [enhanced Send Log](docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/config/enhanced-send-log.mdx), applied personalisation, data source, `RaiseError` scripts.

### _Open

Stores information about your Email Opens. For when you need to know when someone opened your email. Kind of.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        { label: 'Fields', value: 'fields' },

<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
AccountID | Your parent account ID (MID) number | Number |
OYBAccountID | The account ID (MID) number of the child Business Unit that owns the data. If queried on parent Business Unit, it will be `Null` | Number | X
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the open took place | Date |
Domain | The domain at which the open occurred | Text |
IsUnique | Whether the event is unique or repeated | Boolean | X
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Text | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      opened.AccountID
    , opened.OYBAccountID

    , opened.EventDate
    , opened.Domain
    , opened.IsUnique
    , opened.TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID
    , opened.TriggeredSendCustomerKey
FROM _Open AS opened
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Open` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/snippets/sql-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_open.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-where.mdx) to focus on the the first occurence of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/snippets/sql-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. The most valuable data here is the `EventDate` field that lets you know when the email was opened (and whether that happened at all). But with email opens, it's not that easy. In many cases, the lack of open data in this Data View doesn't mean that your recipient for sure did not open the email. And in some instances, tracked open might not mean he did.

:::note You Should Know

There is **no official engagement feedback loop** that informs Marketing Cloud (or any other Marketing Automation Platform) that your recipient opened the email.

All Marketing Automation Platforms put an **invisible 1px wide image in the email** body that is unique for every email you send. When someone opens an email, its images are downloaded from the server. SFMC treats the download of this 1px wide image as proof that the recipient opened the email. And in most cases, it is correct. But...

The **images don't always render** (that's why you should always use alt-text). Some recipients opt-in on a per-email basis to download email graphics. Government audiences might not even have this option. Because of the admin policy, the privacy concerns over engagement tracking or limited internet bandwidth. In such a case, even if the user opens an email, you won't have information about it.

It might lead to weird data, like clicks visible for contacts that did not open. Marketing Automation Platforms track Clicks via a different, more confident approach.

It can also lead to cases where a user has both click and open data, but click data is earlier than the open. Why? Your recipient clicked something in your email and only after that decided to allow his email program to load the images in it.

There might be cases where the data is wrong the other way - when you see that email as opened, but in reality, the user didn't engage with it. It sometimes happens for B2B sends when your recipient's administrator uses bots that automatically check the emails for malicious or spammy content. You can recognise such things by checking the EventDate on `_Open` and `_Click` Data Views, as those bots will open the email and click all its links within a second. Something not possible for an actual human.

2. Use `_click.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-where.mdx) to focus on the first occurence of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/snippets/sql-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. The most valuable data here is the `EventDate` field that lets you know when the email was clicked (and whether that happened at all).
4. You can significantly improve the value of that information by checking the `LinkName` and `LinkContent` fields to understand which links proved interesting for your customers.
5. Suppose you want to create an extensive report on link clicks. In that case, you might want to use the `URL` field instead of `LinkContent` due to the former not showing final personalisation values. It will be much easier to group clicks or even cleanly delete all AMPScript from them.

When working with `_Bounce` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/snippets/sql-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_bounce.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-where.mdx) to focus on the first occurence of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/snippets/sql-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. The `Domain` helps aggregate the bounce data to see any domain-specific problem with deliverability.
4. `SMTPBounceReason` is the most helpful information when you want to understand what happened to your send. Be careful - this value can be configured to a custom string by the server owner. Some administrators are using this to inform you about a specific issue. Some are even faking the information to limit the emails coming to their servers from selected sources.
5. `SMTPCode` is useful for getting additional data on the Bounce Reason. Watch especially for 541 and 554. In most cases, it means you are considered a spammer by the server or already blocklisted. I recommend you to create an Automation with Verification Activity to get an automated warning whenever there are more than a few occurrences. Triage immediately.
6. If you get errors when trying to select `IsFalseBounce` - it might be missing on the SFMC backend. Create a Support Ticket to resolve it.

:::note You Should Know

`SMTPBounceReason` field is `nvarchar(/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-string-functions.mdx#left--right).

### _Complaint

`_Complaint` Data View stores Email Service Providers Feedback Loop (FBL) data. It means that if someone clicks the `Report Spam` button for your email and there is FBL in place, this information will be added to the Data View. It will also result in an unsubscribe event and be visible in the [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe).

Currently, Salesforce Marketing Cloud [supports Feedback Loops](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000353531&type=1) for Bluetie (Excite), Comcast, Cox, Fastmail, Microsoft Hotmail, Italia Online, La Poste, Liberty Global, Locaweb, Mail.ru, OpenSRS (Tucows), Rackspace (Mailtrust), Seznam, Synacor, Telenor, Telstra, Terra, UOL (Brazil), USA.net, XS4ALL and Yandex.

You can additionally [register for the Yahoo Feedback Loop](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000312472&type=1). Gmail also has a [Feedback Loop system](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000353530&type=1), but it works differently and won't be in `_Complaint` Data View.

This Data View, along with [`_Bounce`](#_bounce), should be monitored regularly to assess the health of your email marketing.

When working with `_Complaint` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) for a single engagement with a particular subscriber.
2. Use `_complaint.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-where.mdx) to focus on the first occurence of each event.
3. The `Domain` helps aggregate the Complaint data to see any domain-specific problem with targeting your communication.

## Subscription Data Views

Subscription management in Salesforce Marketing Cloud is complex. Very complex.

It starts with four levels of unsubscriptions:

1. List unsubscribe = no more sends from a particular list or publication list.
2. Business Unit unsubscribe = no more sends from a particular business unit.
3. Master unsubscribe = no more sends from your Marketing Cloud.
4. Global unsubscribe = no more sends from Marketing Cloud. Any, globally.

And it gets even more interesting when you consider that triggering specific unsubscription level depends on email configuration, Email Studio configuration, preference center configuration and subscriber's behaviour.

Oh, and there is no out-of-the-box unsubscription from Data Extensions, which are currently the most popular segmentation and targeting tool.

To give us at least a chance to make sense of that mess, Salesforce created multiple System Data Views related to (un)subscriptions.

:::note You Should Know

Spam Complaint and List-Unsubscribe Header are pretty particular unsubscription use cases. They are added to [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe) and [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribe`](#_businessunitunsubscribes) as unsubscriptions from a list used in send (for example, ID of Publication List selected for the send). In reality, Marketing Cloud will perform automatic unsubscribe from the All Subscriber list (depending on Email Studio settings - Child BU's or Enterprise one), not the list mentioned in `ListID`.

As a result, when querying, you will see the list-specific unsubscribe that doesn't result in unsubscription from the list but instead blocks all commercial communication as a Business Unit or Master unsubscribe.

Custom solution (Automation with Query and Script Activities) will be necessary to perform the list-specific unsubscribe.

:::

### _Unsubscribe

`_Unsubscribe` Data View stores data about unsubscribe events. The wording here is crucial, as it explains the difference from [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) Data View unsubsrciption counts.

In `_Subscribers`, you can check what is the __current subscription status__ for the All Subscribers list. In `_Unsubscribe`, you see the __unsubscription events__ happening from List-Unsubscribe Header, `LogUnsubEvent` API call, Reply Mail Management responses, Complaints and out-of-the-box Preference Center - all linked to a specific [`_Job`](#_job). It is also not limited to All Subscribers but also covers unsubscribes from other types of lists.

It means that status changes like Import Activity, direct API change, manual change in the Email Studio (not Job-specific) will be reflected in the `_Subscribers` Data View, but not in the `_Unsubscribe`. On the other hand, `UnsubEvents` does not necessarily change the Status in the `_Subscribers`. For example, taking care of List-Unsubscribe Header clicks require dedicated Automation to get this data from `_Unsubscribe` Data View and push it to other parts of your consent data model.

This Data View stores data only for six-months, so retention-less `_Subscribers` Data View might show more unsubscribed records if you are not cleaning them from SFMC regularly.

All of this makes `_Unsubscribe` a much better source of knowledge about unsubscription.

JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the unsubscribe took place | Date |
IsUnique | Whether the event is unique or repeated - 1 for the first occurrence, 0 for subsequent | Boolean |
Domain | The domain at which the unsubscribe occurred | Text |

    , unsub.SubscriberKey
    , unsub.EventDate
    , unsub.IsUnique
    , unsub.Domain
FROM _Unsubscribe AS unsub
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Unsubscribe` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Job`](#_job) and [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) to check unsubscription context.
2. Use `_unsubscribe.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-where.mdx) to focus on the first occurence of each event.
3. If you query this Data View on the child Business Unit, it will return only unsubscribe events from that specific BU.
4. The most valuable data here are:
    - `EventDate` field that lets you know when the unsubscription happened
    - `ListID` field that tells you which list is impacted by the unsubscription

:::note You Should Know

If the subscriber clicks "Unsubscribe from All" on the out-of-the-box unsubscription center, it will perform Master Unsubscribe from all Lists. As it is a single event, it will be stored as a single record in the `_Unsubscribe` Data View with random ListID assigned to it. For a complete picture, you will need to check [`_ListSubscribers`](#_listsubscribers) Data View.

:::

---

### _BusinessUnitUnsubscribes

[`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) Data View might give you information about the current state of subscriptions on the All Subscribers list. But if in Email Studio you configure Business Unit Level unsubscribes, this information will not be helpful, as the data stored there will not reflect the subscription status in a specific Business Unit.

Here comes the fresh `_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes` Data View. It shows you the only unsubscribed contacts for each Business Unit. If the contact resubscribes - it will disappear from this Data View.

`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes` Data View will work differently depending on your SFMC [unsubscription configuration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_es_unsubscribe_settings.htm&type=5). You will be able to query it from the Child BU level only for Business Units set to "unsubscribe from this business unit only".

`UnsubReason` possible values:
- Spam Complaint
- Unsubscribed from list details on subscriber properties dialog.
- Unsubscribed by Salesforce Marketing Cloud RMM service based on subscriber Leave/Reply email.
- Unsubscribed by subscriber edit API call.
- Unsubscribed from the Subscription Center

    , buUnsub.UnsubReason
FROM _BusinessUnitUnsubscribes AS buUnsub
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes` Data View:

1. Remember that it stores only currently unsubscribed contacts. Not unsubscribe event data (that's in [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe)) and not other statuses (like bounced, held). It will also not show unsubscribed users after they resubscribed or got deleted.
2. `SubscriberID` or `SubscriberKey` along with `UnsubDateUTC` might fuzzy match the data in this data view with [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe).
3. `UnsubDateUTC`, as name suggests, is in UTC instead of the SFMC-standard UTC-6. Remember to use [`DATEADD`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx#dateadd) to normalize it before comparing to other system dates.
4. The real treat in this data view (apart from finally having an easy option to see Business Unit unsubscribes) is the `UnsubReason` field that can tell you more about the unsubscribe.
5. This Data View, along with [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers), [`_EnterpriseAttribute`](#_enterpriseattribute) and [`_ListSubscribers`](#_listsubscribers), does not have six-month data retention.

:::note You Should Know

`UnsubDateUTC` not only uses a different timezone from the rest of the system dates. It differs by a few milliseconds from [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe) `EventDate`. When querying (SFMC doesn't show seconds for date fields), you won't see it, but the comparison is using the full datetime value.

Because of it, you cannot match it out-of-the-box. [`DATEDIFF`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx#datediff) is here to save the day:

```sql title="DATEDIFF will allow you to compare despite the difference"
DATEDIFF(MINUTE, _Unsubscribe.EventDate, DATEADD(HOUR, -6, _BusinessUnitUnsubscribes.UnsubDateUTC)) < 1
```

### _ListSubscribers

`_ListSubscribers` Data View stores data about the current status of the subscription. It might sound similar to [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) and [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes`](#_businessunitunsubscribes), but there are significant differences:

- `_Subscribers` has data about All Subscribers list only. `_ListSubscribers` shows status for all Lists available in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
- `_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes` has data about contacts unsubscribed from All Subscribers on every Business Unit. `_ListSubscribers` doesn't show Business Unit information, but it covers all Lists and all Statuses.

ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number | X
ListName | The name of the list containing the subscribers | Text | X
ListType | Shows whether the type is list or group | Text |
Status | The status of the subscriber | Text | X

When working with `_ListSubscribers` Data View:

1. Thanks to having `ListID`, `ListName` and `ListType` fields, it allows you to make sense of the `ListID` field available in all other engagement-based System Data Views.
2. This Data View, along with [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers), [`_EnterpriseAttribute`](#_enterpriseattribute) and [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes`](#_businessunitunsubscribes), does not have six-month data retention.
3. You can only query Lists available on the current Business Unit. It's not possible to check Child's List subscription status from the Parent BU. The exception is the All Subscribers list that is shared across all Business Units.

SELECT
      journey.VersionID
    , journey.JourneyID

    , journey.CreatedDate
    , journey.LastPublishedDate
    , journey.ModifiedDate
    , journey.JourneyStatus
FROM _Journey AS journey
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Journey` Data View:

1. `VersionID` field is perfect to [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) with [`_JourneyActivity`](#_journeyactivity). It lets you map multi-channel engagement to a particular Journey (visible in `JourneyName`) and its specific version (as shown in `VersionNumber`).
2. You can also connect it to SMS channel using [_SMSMessageTracking](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) `ON journey.VersionID = smsTracking.JBDefinitionID`.
3. Use `JourneyStatus` to check what is the current Journey Status. It is fantastic for both the [`WHERE`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-where.mdx) statement and a data point for engagement analysis. Think about scheduled Automation that finds all emails performing below expectations and checks which are in the Active Journeys. For all found, it sends you a notification to check and improve. For awful results, you can even use this data in Script Activity to automatically stop the Journey with the SFMC REST API.
4. The Date fields (`CreatedDate`, `LastPublishedDate`, `ModifiedDate`) are cool for automated cleanup of old Journeys, especially when paired with the [`_Sent`](#_sent) data. For example, you can create monthly Automation that checks all Journeys that were last modified at least three months ago and, based on the send volume or performance, stop them and notify you about that.
5. You can query only Journeys that currently exists in your Business Unit.

:::note You Should Know

`_Journey` Data View shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_Journey`. You can query only those Journeys that were created in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always consider this when choosing Business Unit to execute the query and the type of [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) statement.

    , journeyActivity.JourneyActivityObjectID
    , journeyActivity.ActivityType
FROM _JourneyActivity AS journeyActivity
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_JourneyActivity` Data View:

1. There are two key fields here: `VersionID` and `JourneyActivityObjectID`. `JourneyActivityObjectID` lets you match Journey Activity with specific Email Send. Use `TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID` available on either [`_Job`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) [`_Journey`](#_journey) Data View and with this connect specific Email engagement with particular Journey and its exact version. Fantastic for full scope reporting.
2. You can also connect it to SMS channel using [_SMSMessageTracking](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) `ON journeyActivity.ActivityID = smsTracking.JBActivityID`.
3. With the help of [`_Journey`](#_journey) Data View, you can use the `ActivityType` field for an excellent little report created with SQL that will show which Journeys use which channels and what types of logic. For a more in-depth understanding of what happens in Journey, you need to use Script Activity with REST API instead, but SQL is perfect for glancing at the multi-channel use.
4. `_JourneyActivity` Data View holds data about activities from deleted Journeys and Journey Versions, so if you want to see only activities currently in use, [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) [`_Journey`](#_journey) Data View.

:::note You Should Know

`_JourneyActivity` Data View shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_JourneyActivity`. You can query only those Journey Activities that were created in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always consider this when choosing Business Unit to execute the query and the type of [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) statement.

When working with `_AutomationInstance` Data View:

1. This data view stores all Automation __runs__, so you will see here separte row for each execution of the Automation. This is great basic audit tool for logging changes to the automation as well as a nice way to counting the amount of automation executions against licence limits.
2. Since Winter '25 Release `_AutomationActivityInstance` no longer shows data with 24 hours delay. Now all information is available in real-time.
3. If automation run errored out due to system or unclassified error, `AutomationInstanceActivityErrorDetails` will show "System Error occurred. Please contact support for details.". In other cases it will store the first error message. If there are more and you want to find them, you will need to leverage [`_AutomationActivityInstance`](#_automationactivityinstance) Data View.
4. All date fields in this data view are UTC based (/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx) it might be best to use [`GETUTCDATE(/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx#getdate--getutcdate) instead of system date from [`GETDATE(/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx#getdate--getutcdate).
5. `AutomationInstanceID` field is perfect to [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) with [`_AutomationActivityInstance`](#_automationactivityinstance). It lets you find information about execution of each activity within the Automation in the specific run.

:::note You Should Know

`_AutomationInstance` Data View shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_AutomationInstance`. You can query only those Automtion runs that were executed in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always consider this when choosing Business Unit to execute the query and the type of [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) statement.

When working with `_AutomationActivityInstance` Data View:

1. This data view stores all Automation Activity __runs__, so you will see here separte row for each execution of each Activity. It is awesome tool for checking how optimised our Activities are and what errors are troubling our Automations.
2. Since Winter '25 Release `_AutomationActivityInstance` no longer shows data with 24 hours delay. Now all information is available in real-time.
3. If activity run errored out due to system or unclassified error, `ActivityInstanceStatusDetails` will show "System Error occurred. Please contact support for details.". In other cases it will store the error message.
4. All date fields in this data view are UTC based (/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx) it might be best to use [`GETUTCDATE(/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx#getdate--getutcdate) instead of system date from [`GETDATE(/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx#getdate--getutcdate).
5. The start and end dates in this data view can be leveraged with [`DATEDIFF`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-date-functions.mdx#datediff) and [`AVG`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-aggregate-functions.mdx#avg) to calculate average time needed for each activity to finish. This information is crucial to assess whether the current automation Schedule is correct and where the optimisation efforts are required to protect against 30 minutes autokill.
6. `AutomationInstanceID` field is perfect to [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) with [`_AutomationInstance`](#_automationinstance). It lets you find information about the Automation using this Activity.
7. You can also leverage `JobID` field to [`JOIN`](/docs/salesforce/marketing-cloud-engagement/sql/sql-join.mdx) your email sending activities directly with [`_Job`](#_job) and pull send-specific information from engagement Data Views.

## Custom Data Views

On top of all the built-in Data Views mentioned above, there is also a paid option for custom Data Views. As for the possibilities, the sky is the limit. Example? [Lukas Lunow](https://linkedin.com/in/lunow) [highlighted](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/a/293395/91679) a fascinating one that solves the problem of knowing what is the current status of a Contact in a given Journey:

:::note You Should Know

As [shared](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/a/293395/91679) by Lukas, since May 2021, there is longer no possibility to create Custom Data Views leveraging the Journey Builder.

:::

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
JourneyVersionNumber | The version number of the version of the Journey | Number
JourneyName | The name of the Journey | Text
JourneyStatus | Tells you whether the Journey is still Active | Text
ContactKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text
ContactID | Global Contact ID (not Contact Key) | Number
ContactStatus | Tell you whether the contact is still in the Journey (`Active`, `Exited` or even more detailed like `DidNotMeetEntryCriteria`, `ContactExitedByAPI`) | Text
EntryDate | Date of Journey Entry | Date |
ExitDate | Date of Journey Exit - including Goal / Exit Criteria. Null if still in Journey. | Date | x

Yes, you can create a workaround to know whether the Contact is in a given Journey using standard Data Extension and Update Contact Journey Activities at the beginning and end of every Journey. Not only it requires you to remember always to add those additional steps. It also blocks you from using Goals and Exit Criteria.

Custom Data View allow you to eat a cookie and have a cookie.

You can certainly come up with other use cases that could be solved if only you had one additional data point. Now you can.
