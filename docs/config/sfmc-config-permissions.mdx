## Roles and Permissions Best Practices

### Standard Roles vs Custom Roles

The best way to work with Roles and Permissions in Salesforce Marketing Cloud is to leverage standard roles and only build on top of them with custom permissions/roles. Creating custom roles from scratch (even by copying existing standard role) is not recommended. There are two reasons for this:

1. Standard Roles are updated every release to support changes in permissions structure.
2. In many Marketing Cloud spaces, you need multiple permissions from various permission groups.

:::note You Should Know

An excellent example of it might be the Journey Builder.

It is not enough to add full Journey Builder permissions to allow someone to work with that part of Marketing Cloud, because Activities used on Journey canvas require additional permissions to work:

```md
1. Decision Splits and Wait by Attribute requires:
    - Email > Subscribers > Data Extensions > View
    - Salesforce Marketing Cloud > Contacts > Read Contact Data
2. Update Contact requires:
    - Email > Subscribers > Data Extensions > View
    - Email > Subscribers > List > View
3. Engagement Splits requires:
    - Email > Content > Email > View
    - Content Builder > Assets > View
4. Journey Entry Sources requires:
    - Email > Subscribers > Data Extensions > View
    - Email > Subscribers > List > View
    - Salesforce Marketing Cloud > Contacts > Read Contact Data
5. Goals, Exit Criteria, Default Email and Mobile Number settings require:
    - Email > Subscribers > Data Extensions > View
    - Salesforce Marketing Cloud > Contacts > Read Contact Data
```

Such mixes are happening in multiple parts of Marketing Cloud and might change from release to release, which makes creating custom roles from scratch very hard to make and maintain.

:::

However, Standard Roles not always align perfectly with your needs. The widespread use case would be hiding shared folders via permissions or blocking deletion rights for some users. It is where custom work is needed. Below I have listed details on the permissions currently available in Salesforce Marketing Cloud Setup.

For better readability, I have split them by Studio/Builder, so they are not in the same order as in Setup.
