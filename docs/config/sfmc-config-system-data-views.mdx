## Basics

System Data Views are built-in backend Data Extensions that you can use to find information about your subscribers and sends. You cannot change them, but you can leverage their data in SQL queries or pull it to standard Data Extension.

For queries involving data views, implement a 6-month cap. Often the performance is dramatically better limited to no more than 30 days.

## _Subscribers

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
DateUndeliverable | The date an email for the subscriber was returned as undeliverable | Date | X
DateJoined | The date the subscriber joined your list | Date | X
DateUnsubscribed | The date the subscriber unsubscribed from your list | Date | X
Domain | The domain of the subscriber | Text | X
EmailAddress | The subscriber's email address | Email |
BounceCount | The total number of bounces accrued by the subscriber | Number |
SubscriberKey | A potential alternate identifier for subscribers. | Text |
SubscriberType | The subscriber type for the affected subscriber | Text |
Status | The status of the subscriber: active, held, unsubscribed, or bounced. | Text | X
Locale | The locale code for the subscriber | Locale | X

When working with `_Subscribers` Data View:

1. If you are using the query in child Business Unit always check whether you are querying local or enterprise Data View (`ENT.` prefix).
2.  If you need high-level data on your subscribers, this Data View might be enough. If you want to learn more however - why subscriber bounced? Where did he unsubscribe? - you will need to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) some more data points.
3. Use `SubscriberID` to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) data from other engagement-based Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) or [`_Bounce`](#_bounce).
4. `Status` field is great for quick check quality of your data base. It is also good way to manage multiple records. Pull selection of your subscribers with SQL Query, apply a status (for example `'unsubscribed' AS Status`) and leverage Automation to export-transfer-import the Data Extension. This will change data in your All Subscribers list.

## _EnterpriseAttribute

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
_SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record stored. | Number

When working with `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View:

1. If you are using the query in child Business Unit always use `ENT.` prefix as it is enterprise level only Data View.
2. When querying or joining `_EnterpriseAttribute` always be sure to include the underscore before SubscriberID - this is the only Data View that requires it.
3. Despite `Email Address` field is visible in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI when you go to Profile Attributes, it is not part of the `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View. To get an Email Address, query `_Subscribers`.
4. All field names in Data Views are written without spaces. However, `_EnterpriseAttribute` is special, as it is built using the Profile Attributes you created in Email Studio. If your profile attribute name contains space, you will have to use the square bracket notation to capture it: `SELECT [Attribute With Spaces] FROM _EnterpriseAttribute`.

When working with `_Job` Data View:



:::note You Should Know

`_Job` Data View is unique, as it is limited to single Business Unit. You have access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_Job`. You are able to query only those jobs that occured in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always take this into consideration when choosing type of [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) statement.

3. `Domain` is useful for aggregating the bounce data to see whether there is any domain-specific problem with deliverability.
4. `SMTPBounceReason` is the most useful information when you want to understand what happened to your send. Be careful - this value can be configured to a custom string by server owner. Some administrators are using this to inform you about a specific issue. Some are faking the information to limit the emails coming to their servers from selected sources.
5. `SMTPCode` is useful for getting additional data on the Bounce Reason. Watch especially for 541 and 554. In most cases it means you are considered a spammer by the server or already blacklisted. I recommend you to create an Automation with Verification Activity to get automated warning whenever there are more then few occurances. Triage immediately.

:::note You Should Know

`SMTPBounceReason` field is `nvarchar(max)` SQL type and due to that might be longer then the 4000 characters limit for the Data Extension string length in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. If you want to save this data outside of Data View, be sure to use [`LEFT(SMTPBounceReason, 4000)`](../sql/sfmc-sql-string-functions.mdx#left--right).
