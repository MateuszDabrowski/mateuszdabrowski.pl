## Basics

System Data Views are built-in backend Data Extensions that you can use to find information about your subscribers and sends. You cannot change them, but you can leverage their data in SQL queries or pull it to standard Data Extension.

For queries involving data views, implement a 6-month cap. Often the performance is dramatically better limited to no more than 30 days.

:::note You Should Know

Below you can find selected Salesforce Marketing Cloud Data Views. I plan to cover all of them in the future.

## _Subscribers

Stores information about your Subscribers. Great for high level perspective or adding Email Address field to other more detailed Data Views.

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
DateUndeliverable | The date an email for the subscriber was returned as undeliverable | Date | X
DateJoined | The date the subscriber joined your list | Date | X
DateUnsubscribed | The date the subscriber unsubscribed from your list | Date | X
Domain | The domain of the subscriber | Text | X
EmailAddress | The subscriber's email address | Email |
BounceCount | The total number of bounces accrued by the subscriber | Number |
SubscriberKey | A potential alternate identifier for subscribers. | Text |
SubscriberType | The subscriber type for the affected subscriber | Text |
Status | The status of the subscriber: active, held, unsubscribed, or bounced. | Text | X
Locale | The locale code for the subscriber | Locale | X

When working with `_Subscribers` Data View:

1. If you are using the query in child Business Unit always check whether you are querying local or enterprise Data View (`ENT.` prefix).
2. If you need high-level data on your subscribers, this Data View might be enough. If you want to learn more however - why subscriber bounced? Where did he unsubscribe? - you will need to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) some more data points.
3. Use `SubscriberID` to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) data from other engagement-based Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) or [`_Bounce`](#_bounce).
4. `Status` field is great for quick check quality of your data base. It is also good way to manage multiple records. Pull selection of your subscribers with SQL Query, apply a status (for example `'unsubscribed' AS Status`) and leverage Automation to export-transfer-import the Data Extension. This will change data in your All Subscribers list.

## _EnterpriseAttribute

Stores information about your Profile Attributes from Email Studio.

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
_SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record stored. | Number

When working with `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View:

1. If you are using the query in child Business Unit always use `ENT.` prefix as it is enterprise level only Data View.
2. When querying or joining `_EnterpriseAttribute` always be sure to include the underscore before SubscriberID - this is the only Data View that requires it.
3. Despite `Email Address` field is visible in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI when you go to Profile Attributes, it is not part of the `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View. To get an Email Address, query `_Subscribers`.
4. All field names in other Data Views are written without spaces. However, `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View is special, as it is built using the Profile Attributes you created in Email Studio. If your profile attribute name contains space, you will have to use the square bracket notation to capture it: `SELECT [Attribute With Spaces] FROM _EnterpriseAttribute`.

---

## _Job

Stores information about your Email Send Jobs. Great for capturing detailed data about your communication, especially when paired with Send Log. Must have for properly joining various engagement-based Data Views.

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
EmailID | The email ID for the job | Number | X
AccountID | The ID number for the account that performed the job | Number | X
AccountUserID | The ID number for the account user that performed the job | Number | X
FromName | The from name in the email send | Text | X
FromEmail | The from email address in the email send | Email | X
SchedTime | The time the job was scheduled | Date | X
PickupTime | The time the Marketing Cloud application started the job | Date | X
DeliveredTime | The time the email was delivered | Date | X
EventID | The ID for the job event | Text | X
IsMultipart | Whether the job was sent as multipart MIME or not | Boolean |
JobType | The type of job | Text | X
JobStatus | The status of the job | Text | X
ModifiedBy | If modified, the user who modified the job | Number | X
ModifiedDate | The date the job was modified | Date | X
EmailName | The name of the email sent by the job | Text | X
EmailSubject | The subject of the email send | Text | X
IsWrapped | Whether the links in the email were wrapped for tracking | Boolean |
TestEmailAddr | The test email address used in the job | Email | X
Category | The job category | Text |
BccEmail | Any email address send in the BCC field | Email | X
OriginalSchedTime | The original scheduled time for the job | Date | X
CreatedDate | The date the job was created | Date |
CharacterSet | The character set used in the job | Text | X
IPAddress | This value will always be a null value. | Text | X
SalesForceTotalSubscriberCount | The total number of Salesforce subscribers included in the job | Number |
SalesForceErrorSubscriberCount | The total number of Salesforce subscribers included in the job that received errors | Number |
SendType | The type of send used in the job | Text |
DynamicEmailSubject | The dynamic email subject included in the job | ntext | Text | X
SuppressTracking | If tracking information for this job was suppressed | Boolean |
SendClassificationType | The send classification type for the job | Text | X
SendClassification | The send classification for the job | Text | X
ResolveLinksWithCurrentData | If the job resolved links with current data | Boolean |
EmailSendDefinition | The email send definition used in the job | Text | X
DeduplicateByEmail | Whether the email addresses in the job are used to deduplicate subscribers | Boolean |
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Number | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

When working with `_Job` Data View:



:::note You Should Know

`_Job` Data View is unique, as it is limited to single Business Unit. You have access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_Job`. You are able to query only those jobs that occured in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always take this into consideration when choosing type of [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) statement.

## _Sent

Stores information about your Email Sends. Great for understanding who had a chance to receive your message and whose communication was blocked before even leaving your system.

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
AccountID | Your account ID (MID) number | Number |
OYBAccountID | The account ID (MID) number of the child Business Unit. Null on parent Business Unit | Number | X
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the send took place | Date |
Domain | The domain at which the send occurred | Text |
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Text | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

When working with `_Sent` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click), [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) for a single engagement with particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. The most useful data here is the `EventDate` field that let's you know when the email was sent (and whether that happened at all).
3. If you have triggered a send for an email and after few minutes you don't see it here, in most cases it means that the send was blocked and never left Marketing Cloud. Check personalisation, data source, `RaiseError` scripts, etc.

## _Open

Stores information about your Email Opens. For when you need to know when someone opened your email. Kinda.

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
AccountID | Your account ID (MID) number | Number |
OYBAccountID | The account ID (MID) number of the child Business Unit. Null on parent Business Unit | Number | X
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the open took place | Date |

IsUnique | Whether the event is unique or repeated | bool | X
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Text | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

When working with `_Open` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Click`](#_click), [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) for a single engagement with particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_open.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on first occurances of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. The most useful data here is the `EventDate` field that let's you know when the email was opened (and whether that happened at all). But with email opens its not that easy. In many cases lack of Open data in this Data View doesn't mean that your recipient for sure did not open the email. And in some cases tracked open might not mean he did.

:::note You Should Know

There is **no official feedback loop** that informs Marketing Cloud (or any other Email Sender Platform) that the email was opened.

What all the Marketing Automation Platforms do is putting an **invisible 1px wide image in the email** body that is unique for every single email you send. When someone opens an email, its images are being downloaded from the Marketing Cloud server. When that happens with that unique image, SFMC treats it as a proof that the email was opened. And in most cases it is right. But...

The **images are not always rendered**. Many users block images from loading by default. It can be because of comapny policy, the privacy concerns or limited internet bandwith. In such case, even if user opens an email, you won't have information about it.

This might lead to weird data, like clicks visible for contacts that did not open. This is normal, as clicks are tracked via different approach. It can also lead to cases, where user have both click and open data, but click data is earlier then the open. This is also ok - your recipient clicked something in your email and after that decided to allow his email program to load the images in it.

There might however be some cases, where the data is wrong the other way - when you see that email was opened, but in reality the user didn't engage with it. This is sometimes happening for B2B sends when your recipients administrator uses bots that automatically check the emails for malicious or spammy content. You can recognize such things by checking the EventDate on `_Open` and `_Click` Data Views, as those bots will open email and click all its links within few seconds. Something not possible for real human.

## _Click

Stores information about your Email Clicks. Detailed click reporting and behavioral logic is possible thanks to this one.

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
AccountID | Your account ID (MID) number | Number |
OYBAccountID | The account ID (MID) number of the child Business Unit. Null on parent Business Unit | Number | X
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the click took place | Date |
Domain | The domain at which the click occurred | Text |
URL | The URL for the link clicked. Dynamic elements are shown as code: `www.example.com?id=%%SubID%%` | Text | X
LinkName | The link name assigned in the email send | Text | X
LinkContent | The link content assigned in the email send. Dynamic elements are shown as result: `www.example.com?id=12345` | Text | X
IsUnique | Whether the event is unique or repeated|
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Text | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

When working with `_Click` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) for a single engagement with particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_click.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on first occurances of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. The most useful data here is the `EventDate` field that let's you know when the email was clicked (and whether that happened at all). You can greatly improve the value of that information by checking the `LinkName` and `LinkContent` fields to understand which links proved interesting for your customers.

:::note You Should Know

There might however be some cases, where the click data is wrong - when you see that email was clicked, but in reality the user didn't engage with it. This is sometimes happening for B2B sends when your recipients administrator uses bots that automatically check the emails for malicious or spammy content. You can recognize such things by checking the EventDate on `_Open` and `_Click` Data Views, as those bots will open email and click all its links within few seconds. Something not possible for real human.

4. If you want to create a big report on link clicks you might want to use `URL` field instead of `LinkContent` as due to not showing final personalisation values it will be much easier to group clicks or even cleanly delete all AMPScript from them.

## _Bounce

Stores information about your Email Bounces. Best place in Marketing Cloud to understand why your messages are not getting delivered.

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
AccountID | Your account ID (MID) number | Number |
OYBAccountID | The account ID (MID) number of the child Business Unit. Null on parent Business Unit | Number | X
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the bounce took place | Date |
IsUnique | Whether the event is unique or repeated - 1 for the first occurance, 0 for subsequent | Boolean |
Domain | The domain at which the bounce occurred | Text |
BounceCategoryID | The ID number for the bounce category | Number |
BounceCategory | The category of the bounce | Text | X
BounceSubcategoryID | The ID number for the bounce subcategory | Number | X
BounceSubcategory | The subcategory of the bounce | Text | X
BounceTypeID | The ID number for the bounce type | Number |
BounceType | The type of bounce that occurred | Text | X
SMTPBounceReason | The reason for the bounce relayed by the mail system | Text | X
SMTPMessage | The message regarding the bounce from the mail system | Text | X
SMTPCode | The error code for the bounce from the mail system | Number | X
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Number | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

When working with `_Bounce` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) for a single engagement with particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_bounce.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on first occurances of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. `Domain` is useful for aggregating the bounce data to see whether there is any domain-specific problem with deliverability.
4. `SMTPBounceReason` is the most useful information when you want to understand what happened to your send. Be careful - this value can be configured to a custom string by server owner. Some administrators are using this to inform you about a specific issue. Some are faking the information to limit the emails coming to their servers from selected sources.
5. `SMTPCode` is useful for getting additional data on the Bounce Reason. Watch especially for 541 and 554. In most cases it means you are considered a spammer by the server or already blacklisted. I recommend you to create an Automation with Verification Activity to get automated warning whenever there are more then few occurances. Triage immediately.

:::note You Should Know

`SMTPBounceReason` field is `nvarchar(max)` SQL type and due to that might be longer then the 4000 characters limit for the Data Extension string length in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. If you want to save this data outside of Data View, be sure to use [`LEFT(SMTPBounceReason, 4000)`](../sql/sfmc-sql-string-functions.mdx#left--right).
