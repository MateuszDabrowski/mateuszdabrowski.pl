<LeadText content='Dive deep into System Data Views - the backend Marketing Cloud data. Actionable pearls await.' />

## Data Views Basics

System Data Views are **built-in backend Data Extensions** that you can use to find information about your subscribers and sends. You **cannot change them**, but you can leverage their data in SQL queries for quick reports in [Query Studio](../sql/sfmc-sql-basics.mdx#query-studio) or outputting to the standard Data Extension. They are excellent fuel for SSJS logic.

Data Views have **data retention settings set to 6 months**. If you want to store any data for a more extended period, you must create an Automation that will be copying data to your Data Extension.

Be careful, however, as some of the System Data Views can get absurdly big quick, and making copies within your Marketing Cloud Instance may lead to performance issues. In such cases, a much better idea might be to export that data on a scheduled basis to an external Data Warehouse.

Another important point related to Data Views is always knowing which Data View you genuinely want to use. For example, in most cases, you will be interested in parent-level [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) Data View, which means you will need to use the [`Ent.`](../sql/sfmc-sql-from.mdx#enterprise-data-extension) prefix in your query.

:::note You Should Know

Below you can find selected Salesforce Marketing Cloud Data Views focused on Subscribers, Journeys, Email and SMS Channel. I plan to cover the rest of them in the future.

Be sure to check the excellent [Data Views relationship diagram](https://sfmarketingcloudhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/dataviews_2022_v3.jpg) created by [Zuzanna Jarczyńska](https://sfmarketing.cloud) or a bit more complex, but more in-depth [System Tables relationship diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5ff259ed80d742080a34e3c3) created by [Cameron Roberts](https://cameronrobert.com.au). Those will for sure help you with multi-view [`JOIN`s](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx).

Another useful link is [System Data Views SQL Schema](https://github.com/MateuszDabrowski/sfmc-data-views-sql-schema) forked and updated from [Sam Tylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samgtaylor). Ton of info about specific value lengths and ready-to-use snippets to prepare whole database structure for backup. Perfect match for [MarketingThibs' System Data Views SSJS Cloning](https://github.com/MarketingThibs/sfmc-data-views).

## Subscriber Data Views

### _Subscribers

Stores information about your Subscribers. Great for high-level perspective or adding Email Address field to other more detailed Data Views.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        {label: 'Fields', value: 'fields'},
        {label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
DateUndeliverable | The date an email for the subscriber was returned as undeliverable | Date | X
DateJoined | The Date, the subscriber, joined your list | Date | X
DateUnsubscribed | The Date, the subscriber, unsubscribed from your list | Date | X
Domain | The domain of the subscriber | Text | X
EmailAddress | The subscriber's email address | Email |
BounceCount | The total number of bounces accrued by the subscriber | Number |
SubscriberKey | A potential alternate identifier for subscribers. | Text |
SubscriberType | The subscriber type for the affected subscriber | Text |
Status | The status of the subscriber: active, held, unsubscribed, or bounced. | Text | X
Locale | The locale code for the subscriber | Locale | X

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      sub.SubscriberID
    , sub.DateUndeliverable
    , sub.DateJoined
    , sub.DateUnsubscribed
    , sub.Domain
    , sub.EmailAddress
    , sub.BounceCount
    , sub.SubscriberKey
    , sub.SubscriberType
    , sub.Status
    , sub.Locale
FROM _Subscribers AS sub
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Subscribers` Data View:

1. If you are using the query in the child Business Unit, use [`Ent.`](../sql/sfmc-sql-from.mdx#enterprise-data-extension) prefix, as the data is stored on Parent BU level.
2. If you need high-level data on your subscribers, this Data View might be enough. If you want to learn more (for example, why a subscriber bounced, where did he unsubscribe), you will need to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) other Data Views.
3. Use `SubscriberID` to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) data from different engagement-based Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) or [`_Bounce`](#_bounce).
4. The `Status` field is excellent for a quick check of your database quality. It is also nice to manage multiple records. Pull the selection of your subscribers with SQL Query, add a new status with [custom value](../sql/sfmc-sql-select.mdx#custom-values) (for example, `'unsubscribed' AS Status`) and leverage Automation to export-transfer-import the Data Extension to All Subscribers.
5. This Data View, along with [`_EnterpriseAttribute`](#_enterpriseattribute), [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes`](#_businessunitunsubscribes) and [`_ListSubscribers`](#_listsubscribers), does not have six-month data retention.

---

### _EnterpriseAttribute

Stores information about your Profile and Preference Attributes from Email Studio.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        {label: 'Fields', value: 'fields'},
        {label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
_SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record stored. | Number

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      ea._SubscriberID                     AS SubscriberID
    , ea.ProfileAttributeWithoutSpaces
    , ea.[Profile Attribute With Spaces]   AS ProfileAttributeWithSpace
    , ea.PreferenceAttributeWithoutSpaces
    , ea.[Preference Attribute With Spaces]   AS PreferenceAttributeWithSpace
FROM _EnterpriseAttribute AS ea
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


When working with `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View:

1. If you are using the query in the child Business Unit, always use `ENT.` prefix as it is enterprise-level only Data View.
2. When querying or joining `_EnterpriseAttribute`, always include the underscore before SubscriberID - this is the only Data View that requires it.
3. Despite the `Email Address` field is visible in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI when you go to Profile Attributes, it is not part of the `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View. To get the Email Address of your Subscriber, query the `_Subscribers` Data View.
4. Unfortunately, the default Preference Attribute `HTML Email` is not accessible via query.
5. `_EnterpriseAttribute` Data View is unique, as it might contain spaces in field names. You build it by creating the Profile Attributes in Email Studio. If your profile attribute name contains space, you will have to use the square bracket notation to capture it: `SELECT [Attribute With Spaces] FROM _EnterpriseAttribute`.
6. This Data View, along with [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers), [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes`](#_businessunitunsubscribes) and [`_ListSubscribers`](#_listsubscribers) , does not have six-month data retention.

## Email Data Views

### _Job

Stores information about your Email Sends Jobs. Great for capturing detailed data about your communication, especially when paired with Send Log. Must-have for extending your engagement-based Email Data Views.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        {label: 'Fields', value: 'fields'},
        {label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql'},
    ]}

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      job.JobID
    , job.EmailID
    , job.AccountID
    , job.AccountUserID
    , job.FromName
    , job.FromEmail
    , job.SchedTime

    , job.SendClassificationType
    , job.SendClassification
    , job.ResolveLinksWithCurrentData
    , job.EmailSendDefinition
    , job.DeduplicateByEmail
    , job.TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID
    , job.TriggeredSendCustomerKey
FROM _Job AS job
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Job` Data View:

1. `JobID` field will be your bread and butter to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) with other engagement-based Data Views.
2. `EmailName`, `FromName`, and `FromEmail` are handy data points missing in the [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click), [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) Data Views and are worth checking for reporting needs.
3. If you are performing A/B tests or want to analyse the subject line's impact on performance, be sure to pick `EmailSubject`. Pair it with [`CASE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-select.mdx#conditional-values-with-case) to create a great knowledge source for your content team.
4. For debugging purposes, be sure to check out `IsWrapped` and `SuppressTracking` - if you are missing tracking data, `CharacterSet` - if you have problems with formatting, `SendClassification` - if you have issues with unsubscribers or spam complaints.
5. `AccountUserID` field is fantastic for `_Job`-based Audit Log creation. Unfortunately, there is no UI-based easy way to determine which user has which UserID. You can either use SOAP API or match based on these SQL results.

:::note You Should Know

`_Job` Data View is unique among other Email-focused Data Views, as it shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_Job`. You can query only those jobs that occurred in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always consider this when choosing Business Unit to execute the query and the type of [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) statement.

### _Sent

Stores information about your Email Sends. Great for understanding who had a chance to receive your message and whose communication did not leave your system.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        {label: 'Fields', value: 'fields'},
        {label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
AccountID | Your parent account ID (MID) number | Number |
OYBAccountID | The account ID (MID) number of the child Business Unit that owns the data. If queried on parent Business Unit, it will be `Null` | Number | X
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the send took place | Date |
Domain | The domain at which the send occurred | Text |
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Text | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      sent.AccountID
    , sent.OYBAccountID
    , sent.JobID
    , sent.ListID
    , sent.BatchID
    , sent.SubscriberID
    , sent.SubscriberKey
    , sent.EventDate
    , sent.Domain
    , sent.TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID
    , sent.TriggeredSendCustomerKey
FROM _Sent AS sent
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Sent` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click), [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) for a single engagement with a particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/snippets/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. The most valuable data here is the `EventDate` field that lets you know when the email was sent (and whether that happened at all).
3. If you have triggered a send for an email and after a few minutes you don't see it here, in most cases, it means that the send was blocked and never left Marketing Cloud. Check [enhanced Send Log](../usecase/sfmc-enhanced-send-log.mdx), applied personalisation, data source, `RaiseError` scripts.

---

### _Open

Stores information about your Email Opens. For when you need to know when someone opened your email. Kind of.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        {label: 'Fields', value: 'fields'},
        {label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql'},
    ]}

<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
AccountID | Your parent account ID (MID) number | Number |
OYBAccountID | The account ID (MID) number of the child Business Unit that owns the data. If queried on parent Business Unit, it will be `Null` | Number | X
JobID | The job ID number for the email send | Number |
ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the open took place | Date |
Domain | The domain at which the open occurred | Text |
IsUnique | Whether the event is unique or repeated | Boolean | X
TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID | The object ID for the triggered send definition | Text | X
TriggeredSendCustomerKey | The customer key for the triggered send | Text | X

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      open.AccountID
    , open.OYBAccountID
    , open.JobID
    , open.ListID
    , open.BatchID
    , open.SubscriberID
    , open.SubscriberKey
    , open.EventDate
    , open.Domain
    , open.IsUnique
    , open.TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID
    , open.TriggeredSendCustomerKey
FROM _Open AS open
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Open` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Click`](#_click), [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) for a single engagement with a particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/snippets/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_open.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on the the first occurence of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/snippets/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. The most valuable data here is the `EventDate` field that lets you know when the email was opened (and whether that happened at all). But with email opens, it's not that easy. In many cases, the lack of open data in this Data View doesn't mean that your recipient for sure did not open the email. And in some instances, tracked open might not mean he did.

:::note You Should Know

There is **no official engagement feedback loop** that informs Marketing Cloud (or any other Marketing Automation Platform) that your recipient opened the email.

All Marketing Automation Platforms put an **invisible 1px wide image in the email** body that is unique for every email you send. When someone opens an email, its images are downloaded from the server. SFMC treats the download of this 1px wide image as proof that the recipient opened the email. And in most cases, it is correct. But...

The **images don't always render** (that's why you should always use alt-text). Some recipients opt-in on a per-email basis to download email graphics. Government audiences might not even have this option. Because of the admin policy, the privacy concerns over engagement tracking or limited internet bandwidth. In such a case, even if the user opens an email, you won't have information about it.

It might lead to weird data, like clicks visible for contacts that did not open. Marketing Automation Platforms track Clicks via a different, more confident approach.

It can also lead to cases where a user has both click and open data, but click data is earlier than the open. Why? Your recipient clicked something in your email and only after that decided to allow his email program to load the images in it.

There might be cases where the data is wrong the other way - when you see that email as opened, but in reality, the user didn't engage with it. It sometimes happens for B2B sends when your recipient's administrator uses bots that automatically check the emails for malicious or spammy content. You can recognise such things by checking the EventDate on `_Open` and `_Click` Data Views, as those bots will open the email and click all its links within a second. Something not possible for an actual human.

ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number |
BatchID | The batch ID number for any batches used in the send | Number |
SubscriberID | The subscriber ID for the affected subscriber. This number represents the unique ID for each subscriber record. | Number |
SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |
EventDate | The date the click took place | Date |
Domain | The domain at which the click occurred | Text |
URL | The URL for the link clicked. Dynamic elements are shown as code: `www.example.com?id=%%SubID%%` | Text | X

When working with `_Click` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) for a single engagement with a particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_click.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on the first occurence of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/snippets/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. The most valuable data here is the `EventDate` field that lets you know when the email was clicked (and whether that happened at all).
4. You can significantly improve the value of that information by checking the `LinkName` and `LinkContent` fields to understand which links proved interesting for your customers.
5. Suppose you want to create an extensive report on link clicks. In that case, you might want to use the `URL` field instead of `LinkContent` due to the former not showing final personalisation values. It will be much easier to group clicks or even cleanly delete all AMPScript from them.

:::note You Should Know

There might be cases where the click data is wrong - when you see that email as clicked, but in reality, the user didn't engage with it. It sometimes happens for B2B sends when your recipient's administrator uses bots that automatically check the emails for malicious or spammy content.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Bounce` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) for a single engagement with a particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_bounce.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on the first occurence of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/snippets/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. The `Domain` helps aggregate the bounce data to see any domain-specific problem with deliverability.
4. `SMTPBounceReason` is the most helpful information when you want to understand what happened to your send. Be careful - this value can be configured to a custom string by the server owner. Some administrators are using this to inform you about a specific issue. Some are even faking the information to limit the emails coming to their servers from selected sources.
5. `SMTPCode` is useful for getting additional data on the Bounce Reason. Watch especially for 541 and 554. In most cases, it means you are considered a spammer by the server or already blocklisted. I recommend you to create an Automation with Verification Activity to get an automated warning whenever there are more than a few occurrences. Triage immediately.

:::note You Should Know

`SMTPBounceReason` field is `nvarchar(max)` SQL type, and due to that might be longer than the 4000 characters limit for the Data Extension string length in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. If you want to save this data outside of Data View, be sure to use [`LEFT(SMTPBounceReason, 4000)`](../sql/sfmc-sql-string-functions.mdx#left--right).

### _Complaint

`_Complaint` Data View stores Email Service Providers Feedback Loop (FBL) data. It means that if someone clicks the `Report Spam` button for your email and there is FBL in place, this information will be added to the Data View. It will also result in an unsubscribe event and be visible in the [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe).

Currently, Salesforce Marketing Cloud [supports Feedback Loops](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000353531&type=1) for Bluetie (Excite), Comcast, Cox, Fastmail, Microsoft Hotmail, Italia Online, La Poste, Liberty Global, Locaweb, Mail.ru, OpenSRS (Tucows), Rackspace (Mailtrust), Seznam, Synacor, Telenor, Telstra, Terra, UOL (Brazil), USA.net, XS4ALL and Yandex.

You can additionally [register for the Yahoo Feedback Loop](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000312472&type=1). Gmail also has a [Feedback Loop system](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000353530&type=1), but it works differently and won't be in `_Complaint` Data View.

This Data View, along with [`_Bounce`](#_bounce), should be monitored regularly to assess the health of your email marketing.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Complaint` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) for a single engagement with a particular subscriber.
2. Use `_complaint.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on the first occurence of each event.
3. The `Domain` helps aggregate the Complaint data to see any domain-specific problem with targeting your communication.

## Subscription Data Views

Subscription management in Salesforce Marketing Cloud is complex. Very complex.

It starts with four levels of unsubscriptions:

1. List unsubscribe = no more sends from a particular list or publication list.
2. Business Unit unsubscribe = no more sends from a particular business unit.
3. Master unsubscribe = no more sends from your Marketing Cloud.
4. Global unsubscribe = no more sends from Marketing Cloud. Any, globally.

And it gets even more interesting when you consider that triggering specific unsubscription level depends on email configuration, Email Studio configuration, preference center configuration and subscriber's behaviour.

Oh, and there is no out-of-the-box unsubscription from Data Extensions, which are currently the most popular segmentation and targeting tool.

To give us at least a chance to make sense of that mess, Salesforce created multiple System Data Views related to (un)subscriptions.

:::note You Should Know

Spam Complaint and List-Unsubscribe Header are pretty particular unsubscription use cases. They are added to [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe) and [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribe`](#_businessunitunsubscribe) as unsubscriptions from a list used in send (for example, ID of Publication List selected for the send). In reality, Marketing Cloud will perform automatic unsubscribe from the All Subscriber list (depending on Email Studio settings - Child BU's or Enterprise one), not the list mentioned in `ListID`.

As a result, when querying, you will see the list-specific unsubscribe that doesn't result in unsubscription from the list but instead blocks all commercial communication as a Business Unit or Master unsubscribe.

Custom solution (Automation with Query and Script Activities) will be necessary to perform the list-specific unsubscribe.

:::

### _Unsubscribe

`_Unsubscribe` Data View stores data about unsubscribe events. The wording here is crucial, as it explains the difference from [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) Data View unsubsrciption counts.

In `_Subscribers`, you can check what is the __current subscription status__ for the All Subscribers list. In `_Unsubscribe`, you see the __unsubscription events__ happening from List-Unsubscribe Header, `LogUnsubEvent` API call, Reply Mail Management responses, Complaints and out-of-the-box Preference Center - all linked to a specific [`_Job`](#_job). It is also not limited to All Subscribers but also covers unsubscribes from other types of lists.

It means that status changes like Import Activity, direct API change, manual change in the Email Studio (not Job-specific) will be reflected in the `_Subscribers` Data View, but not in the `_Unsubscribe`. On the other hand, `UnsubEvents` does not necessarily change the Status in the `_Subscribers`. For example, taking care of List-Unsubscribe Header clicks require dedicated Automation to get this data from `_Unsubscribe` Data View and push it to other parts of your consent data model.

This Data View stores data only for six-months, so retention-less `_Subscribers` Data View might show more unsubscribed records if you are not cleaning them from SFMC regularly.

All of this makes `_Unsubscribe` a much better source of knowledge about unsubscription.

SubscriberKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text |

    , unsub.EventDate
    , unsub.IsUnique
    , unsub.Domain
FROM _Unsubscribe AS unsub
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Unsubscribe` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Job`](#_job) and [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) to check unsubscription context.
2. Use `_unsubscribe.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on the first occurence of each event.
3. If you query this Data View on the child Business Unit, it will return only unsubscribe events from that specific BU.
4. The most valuable data here are:
    - `EventDate` field that lets you know when the unsubscription happened
    - `ListID` field that tells you which list is impacted by the unsubscription

:::note You Should Know

If the subscriber clicks "Unsubscribe from All" on the out-of-the-box unsubscription center, it will perform Master Unsubscribe from all Lists. As it is a single event, it will be stored as a single record in the `_Unsubscribe` Data View with random ListID assigned to it. For a complete picture, you will need to check [`_ListSubscribers`](#_listsubscribers) Data View.

:::

### _BusinessUnitUnsubscribes

[`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) Data View might give you information about the current state of subscriptions on the All Subscribers list. But if in Email Studio you configure Business Unit Level unsubscribes, this information will not be helpful, as the data stored there will not reflect the subscription status in a specific Business Unit.

Here comes the fresh `_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes` Data View. It shows you the only unsubscribed contacts for each Business Unit. If the contact resubscribes - it will disappear from this Data View.

`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes` Data View will work differently depending on your SFMC [unsubscription configuration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_es_unsubscribe_settings.htm&type=5). You will be able to query it from the Child BU level only for Business Units set to "unsubscribe from this business unit only".

`UnsubReason` possible values:
- Spam Complaint
- Unsubscribed from list details on subscriber properties dialog.

- Unsubscribed from the Subscription Center

    , buUnsub.UnsubReason
FROM _BusinessUnitUnsubscribes AS buUnsub
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes` Data View:

1. Remember that it stores only currently unsubscribed contacts. Not unsubscribe event data (that's in [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe)) and not other statuses (like bounced, held). It will also not show unsubscribed users after they resubscribed or got deleted.
2. `SubscriberID` or `SubscriberKey` along with `UnsubDateUTC` might fuzzy match the data in this data view with [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe).
3. `UnsubDateUTC`, as name suggests, is in UTC instead of the SFMC-standard UTC-6. Remember to use [`DATEADD`](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#dateadd) to normalize it before comparing to other system dates.
4. The real treat in this data view (apart from finally having an easy option to see Business Unit unsubscribes) is the `UnsubReason` field that can tell you more about the unsubscribe.
5. This Data View, along with [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers), [`_EnterpriseAttribute`](#_enterpriseattribute) and [`_ListSubscribers`](#_listsubscribers), does not have six-month data retention.

:::note You Should Know

`UnsubDateUTC` not only uses a different timezone from the rest of the system dates. It differs by a few milliseconds from [`_Unsubscribe`](#_unsubscribe) `EventDate`. When querying (SFMC doesn't show seconds for date fields), you won't see it, but the comparison is using the full datetime value.

Because of it, you cannot match it out-of-the-box. [`DATEDIFF`](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#datediff) is here to save the day:

```sql title="DATEDIFF will allow you to compare despite the difference"
DATEDIFF(MINUTE, _Unsubscribe.EventDate, DATEADD(HOUR, -6, _BusinessUnitUnsubscribes.UnsubDateUTC)) < 1
```

### _ListSubscribers

`_ListSubscribers` Data View stores data about the current status of the subscription. It might sound similar to [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers) and [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes`](#_businessunitunsubscribes), but there are significant differences:

- `_Subscribers` has data about All Subscribers list only. `_ListSubscribers` shows status for all Lists available in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
- `_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes` has data about contacts unsubscribed from All Subscribers on every Business Unit. `_ListSubscribers` doesn't show Business Unit information, but it covers all Lists and all Statuses.

ListID | The list ID number for the list used in the send | Number | X
ListName | The name of the list containing the subscribers | Text | X
ListType | Shows whether the type is list or group | Text |
Status | The status of the subscriber: active, held, unsubscribed, or bounced | Text | X

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_ListSubscribers` Data View:

1. Thanks to having `ListID`, `ListName` and `ListType` fields, it allows you to make sense of the `ListID` field available in all other engagement-based System Data Views.
2. This Data View, along with [`_Subscribers`](#_subscribers), [`_EnterpriseAttribute`](#_enterpriseattribute) and [`_BusinessUnitUnsubscribes`](#_businessunitunsubscribes), does not have six-month data retention.
3. You can only query Lists available on the current Business Unit. It's not possible to check Child's List subscription status from the Parent BU. The exception is the All Subscribers list that is shared across all Business Units.

---

## MobileConnect Data Views

MobileConnect Data Views are unique, as most of them are no longer supported by Salesforce. But some still works. All those data views show data limited to a specific Business Unit.

:::note You Should Know

Most of the MobileConnect data is assigned to Mobile Number, not Contact. It means that it might be shared by a few contacts (if multiple have the same mobile number set) or migrate between them (if the mobile number gets reassigned).

It shouldn't be a big problem in B2C environments, as most people will have their mobile number and keep it long. However, remember that unused numbers might be recycled after a few years by telecom and go back to the market and given to a new user.

Mobile number recycling is much more present in the B2B scenario, where there is a bigger chance for shared mobile numbers and much faster recycling of the numbers. Many companies reuse the phone number of the employees that left.

When working with Mobile Number history of engagement and subscription, take this into consideration.

### _MobileAddress

`_MobileAddress` Data View is officially not supported by Salesforce. But it's too good not to use it. And there is no replacement for it. Why? Because Marketing Cloud still uses this Data View as a backend data source for the MobileConnect Demographics Data.

When working with `_MobileAddress` Data View:

1. There is no guarantee of how long it will work and how long the data will be correct. Be sure you are checking it periodically or - even better - have validation in your code.
2. The rule of thumb when working with MobileConnect is to use the official, supported solutions. Only when they cannot deliver - check whether `_MobileAddress` can help.
3. Do not use the User Interface editor in MobileConnect Demographics part of the Contact to edit information in this Data View. It is broken and overwrites all connected Mobile Numbers with a change made to just one. However, the changes are possible with [SSJS](../ssjs/snippets/ssjs-snippet-mobileconnect-phone-change.mdx) - including ContactID and MobileNumber changes and limited merging. It is the most significant selling point of this Data View.
4. `_MobileAddress` Data View is available in Data Designer within MobileConnect Attribute Group. It allows you to add custom fields to it that you can later leverage in sends.
5. Whenever creating a MobileConnect Contact, be sure to provide the `_MobileNumber` with the dialling code prefix (without the `+` or `00`). For example, Poland has a `+48` dialling code and nine-digit numbers, so the correct format is 48123456789. Double-check whether `_CountryCode` is an appropriate two-letter code (for example, `PL`).
6. The Contact may have multiple Mobile Numbers assigned, but it will receive communication only to the one with the highest `_Priority`.
7. Whenever you add a Mobile Number to a new Contact, for all other Contacts with this number, it gets lower `_Priority` (SFMC assumes that it was transferred).
8. `_ContactID` makes this Data View useful for cross-channel applications. New Data Views ([`_SMSSubscriptionLog`](#_smssubscriptionlog) and [`_SMSMessageTracking`](#_smsmessagetracking)) have Subscriber Key information, but if the Mobile Number is shared, it won't provide the data.

---

### _MobileSubscription

`_MobileSubscription` Data View is officially unsupported by Salesforce. Marketing Cloud still fills it with data, but there is no guarantee of how long it will persist or whether it will be correct.

Worry not, there is a nearly identical Data View available and supported - [`_SMSSubscriptionLog`](#_smssubscriptionlog).

The new Data View contains nearly all the same fields (sans `_CreatedBy` and `_ModifiedBy`) and even adds three more (`LogDate`, `SubscriberKey` and `MovileSubscriptionID`).

When working with `_SMSSubscriptionLog` Data View:

1. SFMC assigns subscription data to Mobile Number, not particular SubscriberKey or Contact. If you reassign the Phone Number to a different contact - Subscriptions will follow.
2. SubscriberKey will be correctly populated if there is one (and only one) Subscriber with the same Mobile Number. Otherwise, it will have either have a `No MobileAddress record has been found or this mobile number` or `Multiple subscriber keys found for this mobile number` as a value.
3. `SubscriptionDefinitionID` is a GUID, and there is no apparent connection to a specific Keyword. But there are two tricks.
   - [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) [`_SMSMessageTracking`](#_smsmessagetracking) Data View and use `KeywordID` and `SharedKeyword` columns to map the GUID to readable Keyword name. If you cannot find this information there, there is a second option:
   - Go to MobileConnect Contacts, open your test contact and make sure he is subscribed to all your Keywords. Click the Attributes tab and scroll to MobileConnect Data. Click on the `Carrier ID` value. It will open a MobileConnect Subscriptions view - the above Data View in User Interface format. If you check the Keyword column, you will see your MobileConnect Short or Long Code along with Keyword in a readable format. Write it down and click `Edit`. Now you will see the same data, but with Keyword GUID. With those two values, you can use a SQL [`CASE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-select.mdx#conditional-values-with-case) statement to convert this Data View to a more readable format.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_SMSMessageTracking` Data View:

1. If you send one SMS to multiple Subscribers, you will have multiple rows of data with different `MobileMessageTrackingID` but the same `MessageID`. Apart from `MessageID` you may also use the `Name` field that contains the asset name from MobileConnect.
2. `KeywordID` and `CodeID` are GUIDs, but the same table also has the readable versions of those columns - `ShortCode` and `SharedKeyword`. `ShortCode`, despite the name, also displays Long Codes.
3. The fields marked above as boolean (like `Sent`, `Delivered`, `IsTest`, `Outbound`) have the value in the form of a number: `0` = false, `1` = true. Some might also be `null` - for example, if a message was outbound, `Outbound` will have the value of `1`, whereas `Inbound` will be `null`.
4. `MessageText` will not only show you the text you sent in your SMS - it will also display it after personalisation is applied. On the one hand, it is great for debugging, as it allows you to check the final content the user received. On the other hand, you won't be able to assess personalisations used across your messaging.
5. `ResponseToMobileMessageTrackingID` is an excellent way to check customer response. You can make [Self-Join](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx#self-join) between inbound `ResponseToMobileMessageTrackingID` and outbound `MobileMessageTrackingID` to output response data in the same line.
6. Some fields in this Data View are filled only under specific conditions:
    - `CampaignID` is populated only when an SMS is sent to Data Extension as Audience or send type is Send to Data Extension. SMS must be connected to a Campaign for the field to be populated.
    - `SendID`, `SendJobID` are populated only for SMS messages sent via Automation Studio's Send SMS Activity or when an SMS is sent to Data Extension as Audience.
    - `SendSplitID`, `SendSegmentID`, `SendGroupID`, `SendPersonID` are populated only when SMS is sent to Data Extension as Audience.
    - `ConversationID` is populated only when a conversation is created with a MO user using AMPScript [`CreateSMSConversation`](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.mc-programmatic-content.meta/mc-programmatic-content/CreateSmsConversation.htm).
7. `Unsub`, `OptIn`, `OptOut` are currently not populated at all. You should pull that data from [`_SMSSubscriptionLog`](#_smssubscriptionlog).
8. `JBDefinitionID` and `JBActivityID` let you cleanly match SMS data to [`Journey`](#_journey) and [`_JourneyActivity`](#_journeyactivity) Data Views using `VersionID` and `ActivityID` respectively. However, it won't work for old (created before October 2020) SMS Activities - for those you can make a [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) using `Name` field: `ON smsTracking.Name = journeyActivity.ActivityName`.
9. `SMSStandardStatusCodeId` and `Description` are great for understanding your SMS send's current status.

#### SMS Status Codes

Code | Status | Definition
-- | -- | --
1000 | QueuedToSfmcSendService | Message queued to internal send service.
1500 | QueueFailureToSfmcSendService | Message failed to queue to internal send service. Retry your send.
1501 | ValidationError | Internal validation error. Retry your send.
2000 | DeliveredToAggregator | Message delivered to the aggregator. The status will be updated when the delivery confirmation comes from the carrier or mobile device. For shared codes, this is the final status.
2500 | FailedToAggregator | Message not delivered to the aggregator. Retry your send.
2501 | UnknownToAggregator | Unknown aggregator error.
2600 | ThrottledToAggregator | Message not accepted by aggregator due to capacity issues. Send will be retried automatically.
3000 | Enroute | Message is en route to carrier. Waiting on carrier confirmation.
3001 | SentToCarrier | Message sent to carrier. Waiting to be accepted by carrier.
3002 | AcceptedByCarrier | Message accepted by carrier. Waiting for delivery confirmation.
3400 | Unknown | Unknown error
4000 | Delivered | Message delivered to mobile device.
4500 | Undeliverable | Message not delivered to mobile device.
4501 | Expired | Message expired. Message exhausted the carrier retry process. Mobile device may be out of carrier range.
4502 | Deleted | Message deleted by the carrier.
4503 | Rejected | Message rejected. Carrier may have detected a loop or assumed that message is spam. This status can indicate an administrative or financial problem between the operator and the end-users.

### _UndeliverableSMS

Stores information about failed message deliveries from MobileConnect.

There might be multiple reasons for the SMS to be undelivered, for example:

- The mobile device is powered off.
- The user is out of range of cellular networks
- The number is for a landline

<Tabs

    values={[
        {label: 'Fields', value: 'fields'},

<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
MobileNumber | Mobile number for the subscriber | Text |
Undeliverable | Whether the subscriber is eligible for future deliveries | Boolean |
BounceCount | Number of times message was not delivered | Number |
FirstBounceDate | Date of the first unsuccessful delivery | Date |
HoldDate | Date when the subscriber can be used in sends again | Date | X

</TabItem>

    , undeliverableSMS.FirstBounceDate
    , undeliverableSMS.HoldDate
FROM _UndeliverableSMS AS undeliverableSMS
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_JourneyActivity` Data View:

1. If `Undeliverable` is `TRUE`, check `HoldDate` to know when the number will be reachable again.
2. Monitor this data view and blocklist numbers with significant `BounceCount` values to clean up your database, save money and protect from spamming potential future owners of the recycled phone number.
3. It's impossible to know the actual delivery status for SMS sends - Marketing Cloud reports only whether the SMS carrier accepted the message. It does not know what happens with it after the carrier takes over. However, most of the SMS messages accepted by carriers are delivered.

## Journey Data Views

### _Journey

Stores information about your Journeys for when context matters.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        {label: 'Fields', value: 'fields'},
        {label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
VersionID | The unique identifier for the version of the Journey | Text |
JourneyID | The unique identifier for the Journey. There are one or more VersionID's associated to a JourneyID. | Text |
JourneyName | The name of the Journey | Text |
VersionNumber | The version number of the version of the Journey | Number |
CreatedDate | The date that the version of the Journey was created | Date |
LastPublishedDate | The date that the version of the Journey was last published | Date | X
ModifiedDate | The date that the version of the Journey was last edited | Date |
JourneyStatus | The current running mode of the Journey. Possible values are Draft, Running, Finishing, and Stopped. | Text

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      journey.VersionID
    , journey.JourneyID
    , journey.JourneyName
    , journey.VersionNumber
    , journey.CreatedDate
    , journey.LastPublishedDate
    , journey.ModifiedDate
    , journey.JourneyStatus
FROM _Journey AS journey
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_Journey` Data View:

1. `VersionID` field is perfect to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) with [`_JourneyActivity`](#_journeyactivity). It lets you map multi-channel engagement to a particular Journey (visible in `JourneyName`) and its specific version (as shown in `VersionNumber`).
2. You can also connect it to SMS channel using [_SMSMessageTracking](#_smsmessagetracking) Data View by making a [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) `ON journey.VersionID = smsTracking.JBDefinitionID`.
3. Use `JourneyStatus` to check what is the current Journey Status. It is fantastic for both the [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) statement and a data point for engagement analysis. Think about scheduled Automation that finds all emails performing below expectations and checks which are in the Active Journeys. For all found, it sends you a notification to check and improve. For awful results, you can even use this data in Script Activity to automatically stop the Journey with the SFMC REST API.
4. The Date fields (`CreatedDate`, `LastPublishedDate`, `ModifiedDate`) are cool for automated cleanup of old Journeys, especially when paired with the [`_Sent`](#_sent) data. For example, you can create monthly Automation that checks all Journeys that were last modified at least three months ago and, based on the send volume or performance, stop them and notify you about that.
5. You can query only Journeys that currently exists in your Business Unit.

:::note You Should Know

`_Journey` Data View shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_Journey`. You can query only those Journeys that were created in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always consider this when choosing Business Unit to execute the query and the type of [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) statement.

### _JourneyActivity

Stores information about Activities available in your Journeys. Must-have for joining Email data with Journey data.

<Tabs
    defaultValue='fields'
    values={[
        {label: 'Fields', value: 'fields'},
        {label: 'SQL Query', value: 'sql'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value='fields'>

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
VersionID | The unique identifier for the version of the Journey | Text |
ActivityID | The unique identifier for the activity. There are one or more ActivityID's associated to a VersionID. | Text |
ActivityName | The name of the activity | Text | X
ActivityExternalKey | The external key associated with the activity | Text |
JourneyActivityObjectID | Use this unique identifier to join to email tracking system Data Views to identify a Journey email's Triggered Send Definition. | Text | X
ActivityType | The type of activity | Text | X

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='sql'>

```sql
SELECT
      journeyActivity.VersionID
    , journeyActivity.ActivityID
    , journeyActivity.ActivityName
    , journeyActivity.ActivityExternalKey
    , journeyActivity.JourneyActivityObjectID
    , journeyActivity.ActivityType
FROM _JourneyActivity AS journeyActivity
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_JourneyActivity` Data View:

1. There are two key fields here: `VersionID` and `JourneyActivityObjectID`. `JourneyActivityObjectID` lets you match Journey Activity with specific Email Send. Use `TriggererSendDefinitionObjectID` available on either [`_Job`](#_job), [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click` ](#_click) or [`_Bounce`](#_bounce) Data View. It is handy when you later use the `VersionID` field to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) [`_Journey`](#_journey) Data View and with this connect specific Email engagement with particular Journey and its exact version. Fantastic for full scope reporting.
2. You can also connect it to SMS channel using [_SMSMessageTracking](#_smsmessagetracking) Data View by making a [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) `ON journeyActivity.ActivityID = smsTracking.JBActivityID`.
3. With the help of [`_Journey`](#_journey) Data View, you can use the `ActivityType` field for an excellent little report created with SQL that will show which Journeys use which channels and what types of logic. For a more in-depth understanding of what happens in Journey, you need to use Script Activity with REST API instead, but SQL is perfect for glancing at the multi-channel use.
4. `_JourneyActivity` Data View holds data about activities from deleted Journeys and Journey Versions, so if you want to see only activities currently in use, [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) [`_Journey`](#_journey) Data View.

:::note You Should Know

`_JourneyActivity` Data View shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_JourneyActivity`. You can query only those Journey Activities that were created in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always consider this when choosing Business Unit to execute the query and the type of [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) statement.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When working with `_AutomationInstance` Data View:

1. This data view stores all Automation __runs__, so you will see here separte row for each execution of the Automation. This is great basic audit tool for logging changes to the automation as well as a nice way to counting the amount of automation executions against licence limits.
2. Key limitation of `_AutomationInstance` is that it shows data with 24 hours delay. If you need real-time information about Automation Studio status, you will still need an API approach. But for not that urget use cases this new option will be much more performant.
3. If automation run errored out due to system or unclassified error, `AutomationInstanceActivityErrorDetails` will show "System Error occurred. Please contact support for details.". In other cases it will store the first error message. If there are more and you want to find them, you will need to leverage [`_AutomationActivityInstance`](#_AutomationActivityInstance) Data View.
4. All date fields in this data view are UTC based (unlike most other Data Views) so when manipulating them with [SQL Date Functions](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx) it might be best to use [`GETUTCDATE()`](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#getdate--getutcdate) instead of system date from [`GETDATE()`](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#getdate--getutcdate).
5. `AutomationInstanceID` field is perfect to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) with [`_AutomationActivityInstance`](#_AutomationActivityInstance). It lets you find information about execution of each activity within the Automation in the specific run.

:::note You Should Know

`_AutomationInstance` Data View shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_AutomationInstance`. You can query only those Automtion runs that were executed in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

When working with `_AutomationActivityInstance` Data View:

1. This data view stores all Automation Activity __runs__, so you will see here separte row for each execution of each Activity. It is awesome tool for checking how optimised our Activities are and what errors are troubling our Automations.
2. Key limitation of `_AutomationActivityInstance` is that it shows data with 24 hours delay.
3. If activity run errored out due to system or unclassified error, `ActivityInstanceStatusDetails` will show "System Error occurred. Please contact support for details.". In other cases it will store the error message.
4. All date fields in this data view are UTC based (unlike most other Data Views) so when manipulating them with [SQL Date Functions](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx) it might be best to use [`GETUTCDATE()`](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#getdate--getutcdate) instead of system date from [`GETDATE()`](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#getdate--getutcdate).
5. The start and end dates in this data view can be leveraged with [`DATEDIFF`](../sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx#datediff) and [`AVG`](../sql/sfmc-sql-aggregate-functions.mdx#avg) to calculate average time needed for each activity to finish. This information is crucial to assess whether the current automation Schedule is correct and where the optimisation efforts are required to protect against 30 minutes autokill.
6. `AutomationInstanceID` field is perfect to [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) with [`_AutomationInstance`](#_AutomationInstance). It lets you find information about the Automation using this Activity.

:::note You Should Know

`_AutomationActivityInstance` Data View shows data limited to a specific Business Unit. Your parent Business Unit has access to [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) and other data from all Business Units, but this is not the case with `_AutomationActivityInstance`. You can query only those Automation Activities that were created in the Business Unit where you execute your SQL snippet.

Always consider this when choosing Business Unit to execute the query and the type of [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) statement.

## Custom Data Views

On top of all the built-in Data Views mentioned above, there is also a paid option for custom Data Views. As for the possibilities, the sky is the limit. Example? [Lukas Lunow](https://linkedin.com/in/lunow) [highlighted](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/a/293395/91679) a fascinating one that solves the problem of knowing what is the current status of a Contact in a given Journey:

:::note You Should Know

As [shared](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/a/293395/91679) by Lukas, since May 2021, there is longer no possibility to create Custom Data Views leveraging the Journey Builder.

:::

Name | Description | Data Type | Nullable
-- | -- | -- | --
JourneyVersionNumber | The version number of the version of the Journey | Number
JourneyName | The name of the Journey | Text
JourneyStatus | Tells you whether the Journey is still Active | Text
ContactKey | The subscriber key for the affected subscriber | Text
ContactID | Global Contact ID (not Contact Key) | Number
ContactStatus | Tell you whether the contact is still in the Journey (`Active`, `Exited` or even more detailed like `DidNotMeetEntryCriteria`, `ContactExitedByAPI`) | Text
EntryDate | Date of Journey Entry | Date |
ExitDate | Date of Journey Exit - including Goal / Exit Criteria. Null if still in Journey. | Date | x

Yes, you can create a workaround to know whether the Contact is in a given Journey using standard Data Extension and Update Contact Journey Activities at the beginning and end of every Journey. Not only it requires you to remember always to add those additional steps. It also blocks you from using Goals and Exit Criteria.

Custom Data View allow you to eat a cookie and have a cookie.

You can certainly come up with other use cases that could be solved if only you had one additional data point. Now you can.
