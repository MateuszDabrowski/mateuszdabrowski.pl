## Basics

System Data Views are built-in backend Data Extensions that you can use to find information about your subscribers and sends. You cannot change them, but you can leverage their data in SQL queries or pull it to standard Data Extension.

For queries involving data views, implement a 6-month cap. Often the performance is dramatically better limited to no more than 30 days.

When working with `_Bounce` Data View:

1. Use `JobID`, `ListID`, `BatchID` and `SubscriberId` or `SubscriberKey` to match various events from multiple Data Views like [`_Sent`](#_sent), [`_Open`](#_open), [`_Click`](#_click) for a single engagement with particular subscriber. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
2. Use `_bounce.IsUnique = 1` in [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) or [`WHERE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx) to focus on first occurances of each event. Example: [Query for Debugging Email Sends](../sql/sfmc-sql-snippet-debugging-email-sends.mdx#solution).
3. `Domain` is useful for aggregating the bounce data to see whether there is any domain-specific problem with deliverability.
4. `SMTPBounceReason` is the most useful information when you want to understand what happened to your send. Be careful - this value can be configured to a custom string by server owner. Some administrators are using this to inform you about a specific issue. Some are faking the information to limit the emails coming to their servers from selected sources.
5. `SMTPCode` is useful for getting additional data on the Bounce Reason. Watch especially for 541 and 554. In most cases it means you are considered a spammer by the server or already blacklisted. I recommend you to create an Automation with Verification Activity to get automated warning whenever there are more then few occurances. Triage immediately.

:::note You Should Know

`SMTPBounceReason` field is `nvarchar(max)` SQL type and due to that might be longer then the 4000 characters limit for the Data Extension string length in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. If you want to save this data outside of Data View, be sure to use [`LEFT(SMTPBounceReason, 4000)`](../sql/sfmc-sql-string-functions.mdx#left--right).
