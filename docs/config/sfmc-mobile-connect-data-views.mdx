## System Data Views

Learn about SFMC [System Data Views Basics](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#data-views-basics) and specific backend tables covering [Email Studio](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#subscriber-data-views), [Journey Builder](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#journey-data-views) & [Automation Studio](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#automation-data-views) data [here](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx).

## MobileConnect Data Views

MobileConnect Data Views are unique, as most of them are no longer supported by Salesforce. But some still works. All those data views show data limited to a specific Business Unit.

:::note You Should Know

Most of the MobileConnect data is assigned to Mobile Number, not Contact. It means that it might be shared by a few contacts (if multiple have the same mobile number set) or migrate between them (if the mobile number gets reassigned).

It shouldn't be a big problem in B2C environments, as most people will have their mobile number and keep it long. However, remember that unused numbers might be recycled after a few years by telecom and go back to the market and given to a new user.

Mobile number recycling is much more present in the B2B scenario, where there is a bigger chance for shared mobile numbers and much faster recycling of the numbers. Many companies reuse the phone number of the employees that left.

When working with Mobile Number history of engagement and subscription, take this into consideration.

### _MobileAddress

`_MobileAddress` Data View is officially not supported by Salesforce. But it's too good not to use it. And there is no replacement for it. Why? Because Marketing Cloud still uses this Data View as a backend data source for the MobileConnect Demographics Data.

When working with `_MobileAddress` Data View:

1. There is no guarantee of how long it will work and how long the data will be correct. Be sure you are checking it periodically or - even better - have validation in your code.
2. The rule of thumb when working with MobileConnect is to use the official, supported solutions. Only when they cannot deliver - check whether `_MobileAddress` can help.
3. Do not use the User Interface editor in MobileConnect Demographics part of the Contact to edit information in this Data View. It is broken and overwrites all connected Mobile Numbers with a change made to just one. However, the changes are possible with [SSJS](../ssjs/snippets/ssjs-mobileconnect-phone-change.mdx) - including ContactID and MobileNumber changes and limited merging. It is the most significant selling point of this Data View.
4. `_MobileAddress` Data View is available in Data Designer within MobileConnect Attribute Group. It allows you to add custom fields to it that you can later leverage in sends.
5. Whenever creating a MobileConnect Contact, be sure to provide the `_MobileNumber` with the dialling code prefix (without the `+` or `00`). For example, Poland has a `+48` dialling code and nine-digit numbers, so the correct format is 48123456789. Double-check whether `_CountryCode` is an appropriate two-letter code (for example, `PL`).
6. The Contact may have multiple Mobile Numbers assigned, but it will receive communication only to the one with the highest `_Priority`.
7. Whenever you add a Mobile Number to a new Contact, for all other Contacts with this number, it gets lower `_Priority` (SFMC assumes that it was transferred).
8. `_ContactID` makes this Data View useful for cross-channel applications. New Data Views ([`_SMSSubscriptionLog`](#_smssubscriptionlog) and [`_SMSMessageTracking`](#_smsmessagetracking)) have Subscriber Key information, but if the Mobile Number is shared, it won't provide the data.

### _MobileSubscription

`_MobileSubscription` Data View is officially unsupported by Salesforce. Marketing Cloud still fills it with data, but there is no guarantee of how long it will persist or whether it will be correct.

Worry not, there is a nearly identical Data View available and supported - [`_SMSSubscriptionLog`](#_smssubscriptionlog).

The new Data View contains nearly all the same fields (sans `_CreatedBy` and `_ModifiedBy`) and even adds three more (`LogDate`, `SubscriberKey` and `MovileSubscriptionID`).

You shouldn't be working with `_MobileSubscription` Data View. Use [`_SMSSubscriptionLog`](#_smssubscriptionlog) instead.

### _SubscriberSMS

`_SubscriberSMS` Data View is a __legacy table__. It is neither supported nor updated, and you won't have records there. Marketing Cloud used it in pre-MobileConnect times, so I do not recommend using it for any projects.

When working with `_SMSSubscriptionLog` Data View:

1. SFMC assigns subscription data to Mobile Number, not particular SubscriberKey or Contact. If you reassign the Phone Number to a different contact - Subscriptions will follow.
2. SubscriberKey will be correctly populated if there is one (and only one) Subscriber with the same Mobile Number. Otherwise, it will have either have a `No MobileAddress record has been found or this mobile number` or `Multiple subscriber keys found for this mobile number` as a value.
3. `SubscriptionDefinitionID` is a GUID, and there is no apparent connection to a specific Keyword. But there are two tricks.
   - [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) [`_SMSMessageTracking`](#_smsmessagetracking) Data View and use `KeywordID` and `SharedKeyword` columns to map the GUID to readable Keyword name. If you cannot find this information there, there is a second option:
   - Go to MobileConnect Contacts, open your test contact and make sure he is subscribed to all your Keywords. Click the Attributes tab and scroll to MobileConnect Data. Click on the `Carrier ID` value. It will open a MobileConnect Subscriptions view - the above Data View in User Interface format. If you check the Keyword column, you will see your MobileConnect Short or Long Code along with Keyword in a readable format. Write it down and click `Edit`. Now you will see the same data, but with Keyword GUID. With those two values, you can use a SQL [`CASE`](../sql/sfmc-sql-select.mdx#conditional-values-with-case) statement to convert this Data View to a more readable format.

When working with `_SMSMessageTracking` Data View:

1. If you send one SMS to multiple Subscribers, you will have multiple rows of data with different `MobileMessageTrackingID` but the same `MessageID`. Apart from `MessageID` you may also use the `Name` field that contains the asset name from MobileConnect.
2. `KeywordID` and `CodeID` are GUIDs, but the same table also has the readable versions of those columns - `ShortCode` and `SharedKeyword`. `ShortCode`, despite the name, also displays Long Codes.
3. The fields marked above as boolean (like `Sent`, `Delivered`, `IsTest`, `Outbound`) have the value in the form of a number: `0` = false, `1` = true. Some might also be `null` - for example, if a message was outbound, `Outbound` will have the value of `1`, whereas `Inbound` will be `null`.
4. `MessageText` will not only show you the text you sent in your SMS - it will also display it after personalisation is applied. On the one hand, it is great for debugging, as it allows you to check the final content the user received. On the other hand, you won't be able to assess personalisations used across your messaging.
5. `ResponseToMobileMessageTrackingID` is an excellent way to check customer response. You can make [Self-Join](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx#self-join) between inbound `ResponseToMobileMessageTrackingID` and outbound `MobileMessageTrackingID` to output response data in the same line.
6. Some fields in this Data View are filled only under specific conditions:
    - `CampaignID` is populated only when an SMS is sent to Data Extension as Audience or send type is Send to Data Extension. SMS must be connected to a Campaign for the field to be populated.
    - `SendID`, `SendJobID` are populated only for SMS messages sent via Automation Studio's Send SMS Activity or when an SMS is sent to Data Extension as Audience.
    - `SendSplitID`, `SendSegmentID`, `SendGroupID`, `SendPersonID` are populated only when SMS is sent to Data Extension as Audience.
    - `ConversationID` is populated only when a conversation is created with a MO user using AMPScript [`CreateSMSConversation`](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.mc-programmatic-content.meta/mc-programmatic-content/CreateSmsConversation.htm).
7. `Unsub`, `OptIn`, `OptOut` are currently not populated at all. You should pull that data from [`_SMSSubscriptionLog`](#_smssubscriptionlog).
8. `JBDefinitionID` and `JBActivityID` let you cleanly match SMS data to [`Journey`](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#_journey) and [`_JourneyActivity`](./sfmc-system-data-views.mdx#_journeyactivity) Data Views using `VersionID` and `ActivityID` respectively. However, it won't work for old (created before October 2020) SMS Activities - for those you can make a [`JOIN`](../sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx) using `Name` field: `ON smsTracking.Name = journeyActivity.ActivityName`.
9. `SMSStandardStatusCodeId` and `Description` are great for understanding your SMS send's current status.
10. `SMSJobID` and `SMSBatchID` are the only way to connect _SMSMessageTracking Data View to [SMS Send Log](./sfmc-enhanced-send-log.mdx).

### _UndeliverableSMS

Stores information about failed message deliveries from MobileConnect.

There might be multiple reasons for the SMS to be undelivered, for example:

- The mobile device is powered off.
- The user is out of range of cellular networks
- The number is for a landline

SELECT
      undeliverableSMS.MobileNumber
    , undeliverableSMS.Undeliverable
    , undeliverableSMS.BounceCount

When working with `_JourneyActivity` Data View:

1. If `Undeliverable` is `TRUE`, check `HoldDate` to know when the number will be reachable again.
2. Monitor this data view and blocklist numbers with significant `BounceCount` values to clean up your database, save money and protect from spamming potential future owners of the recycled phone number.
3. It's impossible to know the actual delivery status for SMS sends - Marketing Cloud reports only whether the SMS carrier accepted the message. It does not know what happens with it after the carrier takes over. However, most of the SMS messages accepted by carriers are delivered.
