## What are Marketing Cloud's Features On Demand?

Salesforce Marketing Cloud is full of features straight out of the box. You can spend hours going through various panels and menus, discovering more options to make the instance your own and align it to the business needs.

There is, however, a group of features that you won't be able to find. Salesforce hid them until you ask the Support (Free) or Account Executive (Paid) to unlock them. SFMC Features On Demand.

Why are they not available by default? There are various reasons:

1. Some require irreversible changes, so Salesforce wants to be sure you know what you want.
2. Some are putting a strain on the backend, so it is better to keep them off by default and enable only when a client needs them.
3. Some have an additional cost and require a purchase before enabling.
4. Some are dependent on specific modules, so there is no need to have them by default.
5. Some will probably be added as a standard in the future (just as it has been done with previously on-demand Profile Attributes, Script Activity, Shared Folders and others - more on that in the bottom).
6. Some are no longer provided even when you ask (sweet, sweet Code Activity for Journey Builder...)

I always wanted to have a full list of those features but could never find it. So here it is.

:::note You Should Know

This document is a living thing. Salesforce adds, deletes and updates the Features On Demand with Marketing Cloud releases. I try to keep it up-to-date, but your help with this task will be appreciated.

If you found anything below no longer correct or know yet another hidden SFMC feature - please [let me know](mailto:feedback@mateuszdabrowski.pl?subject=Feedback%20on%20Features%20On%20Demand%20article).
