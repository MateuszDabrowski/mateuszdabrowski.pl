## Permissions Best Practices

### Standard vs Custom Roles

The best way to work with Roles and Permissions in Salesforce Marketing Cloud is to leverage standard roles and only build on top of them with custom permissions/roles. Creating custom roles from scratch (even by copying existing standard role) is not recommended. There are two reasons for this:

1. Standard Roles are updated every release to support changes in permissions structure.
2. In many Marketing Cloud spaces, you need multiple permissions from various permission groups.

:::note You Should Know

An excellent example of it might be the Journey Builder.

It is not enough to add full Journey Builder permissions to allow someone to work with that part of Marketing Cloud, because Activities used on Journey canvas require additional permissions to work:

```md
1. Decision Splits and Wait by Attribute requires:
    - Email > Subscribers > Data Extensions > View
    - Salesforce Marketing Cloud > Contacts > Read Contact Data
2. Update Contact requires:
    - Email > Subscribers > Data Extensions > View
    - Email > Subscribers > List > View
3. Engagement Splits requires:
    - Email > Content > Email > View
    - Content Builder > Assets > View
4. Journey Entry Sources requires:
    - Email > Subscribers > Data Extensions > View
    - Email > Subscribers > List > View
    - Salesforce Marketing Cloud > Contacts > Read Contact Data
5. Goals, Exit Criteria, Default Email and Mobile Number settings require:
    - Email > Subscribers > Data Extensions > View
    - Salesforce Marketing Cloud > Contacts > Read Contact Data
```

Such mixes are happening in multiple parts of Marketing Cloud and might change from release to release, which makes creating custom roles from scratch very hard to make and maintain.

:::

However, Standard Roles not always align perfectly with your needs. The widespread use case would be hiding shared folders via permissions or blocking deletion rights for some users. It is where custom work is needed.


:::note You Should Know

If you want to quickly:

- clone permissions of a standard role,
- move a tested and proven role between SFMC accounts or
- document your custom solution

You can do it easily with a [ready-to-use JavaScript snippet](../js/snippets/export-import-document-sfmc-roles.mdx).

### Permission Overlap

When working with multiple roles or overlapping permissions, be sure to check what is the outcome on the user.

Marketing Cloud goes with the most restrictive resulting permission possible:

1. If at least one permission (role-based or individual) is set to Deny - the user will __not__ be able to use the feature.
2. If there is neither Allow nor Deny permission - the user will __not__ be able to use the feature.
3. If there is at least one Allow permission and not even one Deny permission - the user will be able to use the feature.

You can check the outcome by going to Setup > Users > Users > clicking checkbox next to a user > clicking Manage Roles > Edit Permissions. In this place, you can not only configure individual permissions but also, by expanding to the final permission level, check current result permission along with the source for that state.

## SFMC Permissions

 Below I have listed details on the permissions currently available in Salesforce Marketing Cloud Setup. For better readability, I have split them by Studio/Builder, so they are not in the same order as in Setup.

 To search for specific permission you can use site search in top right or browser search (`CMD`/`Ctrl`+`F` keys).

## Backup of Standard Roles

As the default System Roles permission sets in Salesforce Marketing Cloud can be edited freely and [currently there is no easy way to revert those changes](../../../sites/ideas/marketing-cloud-ideas/#restore-default-permissions-for-sfmc-standard-system-roles), I created a backup repository for you with all out-of-the-box configurations. Perfect for use with the [permission import soluton](../../js/snippets/export-import-document-sfmc-roles/).
