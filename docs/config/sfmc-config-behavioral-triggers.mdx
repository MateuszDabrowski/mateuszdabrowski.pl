## Marketing Cloud Behavioral Triggers

Behavioral Triggers are a solution for easily moving abandoned engagement data from your e-commerce to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. They enables powerful win-back communication to be created with minimal technical knowledge in express time.

Currently, there are three scenarios avaialble:

1. [Abandoned Cart](#abandoned-cart)
2. [Abandoned Browse](#abandoned-browse)
3. [Abandoned Wishlist](abandoned-wishlist)

What Behaviortal Triggers does in each case is push relevant data (items left in the cart, browsed without conversion or added to wishlist) to the Einstein Backend and - after configured time - to Marketing Cloud Data Extension.

Then you can leverage this data extension as both Journey Entry, as well as a source of personalization using built-in Behaviortal Trigger Content Block that allows you to use clean UI to configure basic dynamic content using the obtained engagement data.

As you can see, if you already use Einstein Recommendations, most of the required work is already done and whole implementation should take you just a few minutes.
