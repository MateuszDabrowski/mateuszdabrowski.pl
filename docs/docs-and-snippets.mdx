## Zen of SFMC

Salesforce Marketing Cloud is a complex and flexible tool. This combination is a dream-come-true set for enterprise Marketing Automation tools, but on the other hand, it enables mistakes and messy solutions. Find the right path to success through a best-practice fuelled checklist full of tool-based explanations and examples.

## Server-Side JavaScript

SSJS is an XX-century version of JavaScript paired with proprietary libraries created by Salesforce. It is one of the programmatic tools useful to leverage Marketing Cloud to its fullest potential. I am creating this documentation to make my (and hopefully also yours) work easier.

### SSJS Documentation

- [If & Switch](./ssjs/ssjs-if-and-switch.mdx)
- [Loops](./ssjs/ssjs-loops.mdx)
- [Debugging](./ssjs/debugging-ssjs.mdx)
- [Style Guide](./ssjs/ssjs-style-guide.mdx)
- [Performance](./ssjs/ssjs-vs-ampscript-performance.mdx)

### SSJS Snippets

- [AMPScript in SSJS](./ssjs/ssjs-snippet-ampscript-in-ssjs.mdx)
- [MobileConnect Phone Change](./ssjs/ssjs-snippet-mobileconnect-phone-change.mdx)
- [SSJS Script Template](./ssjs/ssjs-snippet-ssjs-script-template.mdx)

## JavaScript

In this part, I am gathering selected elements of modern vanilla JavaScript that I find helpful for marketing technologists. Expect guides on asynchronous calls to API and backend resources, form-focused DOM manipulation and playing with data objects.

### JS Documentation

- [If & Switch](./js/js-if-and-switch.mdx)
- [Loops](./js/js-loops.mdx)
- [Document Object Model (DOM)](./js/js-dom.mdx)

## AMPScript

AMPScript is a proprietary scripting language in Salesforce Marketing Cloud along with [SSJS](#Server-Side-JavaScript). Out of the two, it is simpler and more performant, but too limited for complex solutions. Good starting point for marketers without development experience. Best option for scripting in messaging.

### AMPScript Documentation

- [Style Guide](./ampscript/ampscript-style-guide.mdx)
- [Performance](./ssjs/ssjs-vs-ampscript-performance.mdx)

### AMPScript Snippets

## SFMC SQL

To fully leverage the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Data Extensions and Automation Studio, SQL is a must-have. Here I gathered both the language basics and some of the most valuable snippets to copy and paste shamelessly.

### SQL Documentation

- [SQL Basics](./sql/sfmc-sql-basics.mdx)
- [Select](./sql/sfmc-sql-select.mdx)
- [From](./sql/sfmc-sql-from.mdx)
- [Join](./sql/sfmc-sql-join.mdx)
- [Where](./sql/sfmc-sql-where.mdx)
- [Case](./sql/sfmc-sql-case.mdx)
- [Like](./sql/sfmc-sql-like.mdx)
- [String Functions](./sql/sfmc-sql-string-functions.mdx)
- [Date Functions](./sql/sfmc-sql-date-functions.mdx)
- [Numeric Functions](./sql/sfmc-sql-numeric-functions.mdx)
- [Conversion Functions](./sql/sfmc-sql-conversion-functions.mdx)
- [Aggregate Functions](./sql/sfmc-sql-aggregate-functions.mdx)
- [NULL Functions](./sql/sfmc-sql-null-functions.mdx)
- [Style Guide](./sql/sfmc-sql-style-guide.mdx)

## SFMC Config

Many things in Salesforce Marketing Cloud aren't coding but have a massive impact on the code. Permissions. System Data Views. Configuration options. Here I focus on the most important ones that are crucial for Marketing Cloud developers.

- [Permissions](./config/sfmc-config-permissions.mdx)
- [System Data Views](./config/sfmc-config-system-data-views.mdx)
- [Features On Demand](./config/sfmc-config-features-on-demand.mdx)
- [AppExchange Solutions](./config/sfmc-config-appexchange-solutions.mdx)

<Button
    link='./category/sfmc-config/'
    text='Read about SFMC Config'
/>

## SFMC Use Cases

Knowing how to code is one thing. Knowing what to code is another. In Use Cases, I focus not on specific features of the Marketing Cloud configuration or its programming languages but rather on using them to drive business value. Take a look and pick what you need.

- [Solve with Cloud Page Apps](./usecase/sfmc-cloud-page-apps.mdx)
- [Power of Code Resources](./usecase/sfmc-code-resource.mdx)
- [Contact Deletion Process](./usecase/sfmc-contact-deletion.mdx)
- [Enhanced Send Log](./usecase/sfmc-enhanced-send-log.mdx)
- [Behavioral Triggers](./usecase/sfmc-behavioral-triggers.mdx)

## Interaction Studio

Interaction Studio is a cross-channel real-time hyper-personalisation engine in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Behind that cool-looking description is a powerful tool that lets your company adapt every point of contact to each person. Neat!
