<LeadText content="SSJS + JS documentation and code snippets that I find useful for developing Marketing Automation." />

## Server-Side JavaScript

SSJS is an XX-century-version of JavaScript paired with proprietary libraries created by Salesforce. It is one of the programmatic tools useful to leverage Marketing Cloud to its fullest potential. I am creating this documentation to make my (and hopefully also yours) work easier.

## JavaScript

In this part, I am gathering selected elements of modern vanilla JavaScript that I find useful for marketing technologists. Expect guides on asynchronous calls to API and backend resources, form-focused DOM manipulation and playing with data objects.

## Changes

I'm updating the docs ongoingly, so expect changes. You can track those by watching and starring the website's [Github Repository](https://github.com/MateuszDabrowski/mateuszdabrowski.pl). Additional languages might come (I'm thinking about you, SQL).
